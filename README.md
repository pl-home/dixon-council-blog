This is an amateur attempt at using AI to make city government more accessible and transparent for your average citizen.  

My name is Ryan Latvaitis and I'm a resident of Dixon, IL.  I try to keep up with local affairs but find it challenging to make time to watch the videos that Dixon records of our council meetings.  I had the idea of using AI tools like Claude to create a transcript, summarize it, and publish it on a website.  

This is a work in progress, and currently (and perhaps will remain) a vibe-coded mess!  If you have suggestions on how to improve this, let me know.
