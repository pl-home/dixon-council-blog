## Black History Month Recognition

The council devoted the first portion of the meeting to its ninth annual Black History Month celebration, featuring the Ike Mercer Certificate of Achievement Award, named for the late community volunteer.

**This year's Ike Mercer Award** went to **Dantron Dodd**, co-owner of T&D Barbecue and co-founder of WestFest, an annual September community festival now entering its third year. Dodd was introduced by previous award winner Rashad Lane and received a video message from **Diamond Robinson**, a past recipient currently serving in the U.S. Navy in Bahrain with Task Force 55. Dodd thanked his family, supporters, and co-founder Brandon Hill of Bee's Lemonade.

**The Lifetime Achievement Award** was presented posthumously to **George W. Reed** (1919–), a World War II Buffalo Soldier who served with the 9th and 10th Cavalry, a prize fighter in New York under the ring name Kit Colby, a Golden Gloves trainer in Dixon, and co-founder of the Girls Ponytail Softball League. His son Terry accepted the award. Councilman Veneer, who organizes the annual recognition, noted the celebration marks the 100th anniversary of what began as Negro History Week in 1926.

Several council members also noted the passing of **Rev. Jesse Jackson**, who died earlier that day.

## Routine Business

- **Minutes** from the February 2 regular and executive sessions were approved unanimously.
- **Total labor and outside claims** of **$1,971,084.07** were approved. Mayor Hughes noted that over half of the outside claims amount was the city reinvesting in its own certificates of deposit ($1 million). Other notable expenditures included $193,582 for wastewater treatment plant improvements and $125,695 for second-floor work at the public safety building.
- **Year-to-date financials** through January 2026 were accepted.

## IT and Cybersecurity Report

IT Director **Phil Hauer** gave the council an overview of the department's work, emphasizing that cybersecurity — not hardware repair — now dominates his workload. Key points:

- **Mandatory cybersecurity training** for all city employees has been in place since 2023, per state law. Monthly phishing tests have been effective; employees now routinely flag suspicious emails rather than clicking on them.
- **Network vulnerability scanning** runs weekly using in-house software, which is cheaper and more current than one-time third-party audits. The city has significantly reduced its exposure to potential intrusions.
- **"Zero Trust" software** blocks any unapproved programs from running on city computers, preventing malware from executing even if an employee clicks a bad link.
- **Cloud migration** is underway for the LaserFiche document management system and Casel finance software. The police department's LaserFiche migration is expected this summer. The moves should reduce hardware costs over time.
- A **new email spam filter** is being implemented soon.

## Motions and Approvals

**Self-storage special use petition:** A petition from Minify Self-Storage Genoa LLC was referred to the Plan Commission. No details were discussed; this is a procedural step.

**Emergency generator repair at the public safety building:** The council waived the formal bid process and approved a **$36,649** emergency repair by Helm Electric to replace a failed transfer switch in the building's generator system. City staff explained that without the repair, the building — which houses IT infrastructure for both the public safety building and city hall — has only about 15 minutes of battery backup during a power outage. The generator, when functioning, powers the entire building except air conditioning condensers and kicks in within 60 seconds.

**Tactical communication headsets:** The council approved spending **$40,726.74** on 27 helmet-mounted communication headsets for the multi-agency Joint Operations Group (SWAT team), which includes Dixon PD, Lee County Sheriff, and both city and rural fire departments. The Deputy Chief noted that over $17,000 was raised through fundraising from local donors and businesses. The remainder comes from existing funds across the participating agencies. The headsets also provide hearing protection.

**2026 Chevrolet Tahoe police vehicle:** Approved for purchase from Carl Emergency Vehicles, which will also handle the police equipment installation — described as a "turnkey" arrangement. The vehicle was set aside by the dealer in December. Council members discussed the ongoing tension between supporting local vendors and the practical reality that few local shops can handle police vehicle upfitting in a timely manner. The Deputy Chief indicated recent conversations with the chief are aimed at developing a better long-term approach to vehicle purchasing. **Funding comes from the DUI fund** (see below), requiring no new money.

**DUI fund budget amendment:** The council approved moving **$90,000** within the police DUI fund from one line item to the vehicle line item to pay for the Tahoe. No new funds involved.

**Collateral assignment — Dixon Lodging/Sauk Valley Bank:** The council approved acknowledging a collateral assignment of TIF (Tax Increment Financing) funds between Dixon Lodging LLC and Sauk Valley Bank. The city stressed this creates no financial obligation for Dixon — it simply acknowledges the bank's collateral interest in future TIF payments.

**Disposal of police vehicles:** Four aging police vehicles were approved for sale via online auction: a 2009 Chevy Tahoe, a 2011 Ford F-150, a 2011 Ford Edge, and a 2013 Dodge Charger (the current SRO vehicle). One council member noted that residents had asked why so many police vehicles sit unused in the public safety building parking lot.

**Street department budget transfer:** A **$15,000** transfer within the street department budget — from full-time salaries to maintenance and repairs — was approved to cover dump truck breakdowns during plowing season. No new money.

**Water department budget transfer:** A **$15,000** shift from repair/maintenance to engineering was approved to cover unplanned costs related to a grant application and new IEMA regulatory compliance. No new money.

**Closed session minutes review:** A routine resolution regarding previously reviewed executive session minutes was approved.

## Council Comments

- **Mayor Hughes** highlighted five Dixon High School wrestlers advancing to state competition, with two potential alternates, and expressed hope for the girls wrestling program as well.
- **Councilman Bishop** added that the wrestling team won regionals and sectionals and will compete for a team trophy in Bloomington. He also recognized **SRO (School Resource Officer) Week**, praising officers Matt Coffey and Ryan McQuethy for their work in Dixon schools, noting the relationships they build with students go well beyond law enforcement.
- **Councilman Considine** thanked Veneer for his Black History Month efforts and paid tribute to Rev. Jesse Jackson.
- **Councilman Ores** echoed the SRO recognition.
- **Councilman Veneer** kept it simple: "Dixon's just a great place to call home."

The meeting adjourned with no further business. No public comments were made.
