# Dixon City Council Meeting Summary
## February 17, 2026

**Black History Month Recognition Takes Center Stage**

The council's regular meeting opened with its ninth annual Black History Month celebration, organized by Councilman Mike Veneer. This year marks the 100th anniversary of what began as Negro History Week in 1926.

**Ike Mercer Certificate of Achievement** was awarded to **Dantron Dodd**, co-owner of T&D Barbecue and co-founder of WestFest, a community festival entering its third year this September. Previous award winner Diamond Robinson, currently serving with the U.S. Navy's Task Force 55 in Bahrain, introduced Dodd via video call. Rashad Lane presented the award in person.

The **Lifetime Achievement Award** went posthumously to **George W. Reed** (1919–), a World War II Buffalo Soldier who rode with the 9th and 10th Cavalry, a prize fighter in New York City under the ring name Kit Colby, a Golden Gloves trainer in Dixon, and co-founder of the Girls Ponytail Softball League. His son Terry accepted the award.

Pastor Michael Cole of the Worship Center gave the invocation and noted the passing of Rev. Jesse Jackson, which Councilman Considine also acknowledged during council reports.

**Claims and Finances**

The council approved $1,971,084.07 in total labor and outside claims. Mayor Hughes noted that more than half — a $1 million CD — was the city reinvesting its own money. Other significant expenditures included $193,582 for wastewater treatment plant improvements and $125,695 for public safety building second-floor work. Year-to-date financials through January 2026 were accepted without discussion.

**IT and Cybersecurity Report**

IT Director Phil Hauer told the council that cybersecurity — not hardware repair — now dominates his department's work. Key points:

- **Mandatory cybersecurity training** for all city employees has been in place since 2023, as required by state law. Phishing test emails have proven effective; employees now regularly flag suspicious messages rather than clicking on them.
- **Cloud migration** is underway for the city's LaserFish document management and Casel finance software, which should reduce hardware costs over time.
- **Weekly network vulnerability scanning** has significantly reduced the city's exposure to potential intrusions.
- A **"Zero Trust" program** blocks any software not on an approved list from running on city computers, preventing malware downloads.
- A **new email spam filter** will be rolled out soon.

**Emergency Generator Repair — Public Safety Building**

The council waived the formal bid process and approved a $36,649 emergency repair to the Public Safety Building's electrical transfer switch, which failed during a routine test. Without the repair, the building — which also houses IT systems serving City Hall — relies on battery backup lasting only about 15 minutes during a power outage. Helm Electric will handle the work using a transfer switch already in stock, avoiding a lengthy wait for parts.

**Tactical Communication Headsets — $40,726.74**

The council approved the purchase of 27 tactical communication headsets for the multi-agency Joint Operations Group (SWAT team), which includes Dixon PD, Lee County Sheriff's Office, and both city and rural fire departments. More than $17,000 was raised through fundraising to offset the cost. Deputy Chief explained that communication failures have been the team's "Achilles heel" and that the new headsets, which mount to ballistic helmets, will also protect hearing during gunfire.

**New Police Vehicle — 2026 Chevrolet Tahoe**

The council approved the purchase of a 2026 Chevrolet Tahoe with police package from Carl Emergency Vehicles. The vehicle was set aside by the vendor in December. Funding comes from the police DUI fund ($90,000 transferred to the vehicle line item) — no new money. Discussion touched on the council's preference for using local vendors, but members acknowledged that the turnkey approach — buying the vehicle and having it upfitted in one place — avoids months of delay. The council and police leadership indicated they plan to develop a more systematic vehicle replacement approach going forward.

---

**Disposal of Four Police Vehicles**

The council authorized selling four aging police vehicles through online auction: a 2009 Chevy Tahoe, a 2011 Ford F-150, a 2011 Ford Edge, and a 2013 Dodge Charger (used as a school resource officer vehicle). A question about vehicles sitting in the Public Safety Building parking lot prompted a brief, lightly humorous exchange.

**Budget Transfers (No New Money)**

- **Street Department:** $15,000 shifted from salaries to maintenance and repairs to cover unexpected dump truck breakdowns during plowing season.
- **Water Department:** $15,000 shifted from repair/maintenance to engineering for unplanned work related to a grant application and new IEMA regulatory compliance.

---

**Other Business**

- A petition for a special use from **Minify Self Storage Genoa LLC** was referred to the Plan Commission.
- A **collateral assignment** between Dixon Lodging LLC and Sauk Valley Bank regarding TIF funds was approved. The city emphasized this creates no financial obligation for Dixon — it merely acknowledges the TIF funds are assigned as collateral.
- **Closed session minutes** from a prior executive session review were approved.

**Council Reports of Note**

- **Dixon High School wrestling:** Five wrestlers are headed to the individual state tournament, with two alternates possible. The team also won regionals and sectionals and will compete for a team trophy in Bloomington.
- **School Resource Officer Week:** Councilman Bishop highlighted officers Matt Coffey and Ryan McQuethy, calling their daily presence in schools "invaluable" — especially given Dixon's history with a school shooting.
- Mayor Hughes noted a recent tour of the Public Safety Building and called it impressive.

The meeting adjourned after completing all agenda items.
