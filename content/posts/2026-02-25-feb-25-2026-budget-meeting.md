# Dixon City Council Special Meeting Summary
## Wednesday, February 25 — Budget Work Session (Night Two)

**Present:** Mayor Hughes, Councilmen Bishop, Considine, Orris, and Veneer. A follow-up budget session was announced for Monday at 4 p.m.

### Human Resources Budget

Chief People Officer Danelle presented what is largely the old administration budget reorganized under a new HR department. Notable additions include a $40,000 placeholder for a part-time temporary HR generalist to help implement the city's new UKG software platform and prepare for union contract negotiations beginning in 2027. About $8,000 was added for professional development, including SHRM and IPELRA conferences. The rest — salary, employee recognition, engagement programs — transferred over from the old administration budget, which shrank by roughly $200,000 as a result.

### Information Technology Budget

IT Manager Alan reported the budget is up about $43,000. The main drivers: moving the Civic Cassell system to the cloud, Lee County GIS costs, and firewall maintenance — totaling $28,800 in new expenses. He noted $6,000 in savings from reduced licenses partially offset the increases. Hardware costs are climbing sharply, prompting a $6,000 bump for equipment like computers, phones, and monitors. He also explained that a three-year prepaid firewall maintenance deal from 2022 has expired, meaning the city now faces annual payments of roughly $12,000. Replacement hardware may be needed in two to three years.

### Dixon Municipal Band

Business Manager Chris Hammett and Director John James gave an upbeat report. The band has grown from a typical 45 members to 52 last summer, with 55 budgeted this year — approaching the physical limits of the Page Park bandshell stage. Summer concert attendance averaged 150 people per show, and the band is attracting musicians from over 90 miles away.

The budget is up about $10,000, driven by the larger roster and a mileage stipend for musicians traveling more than 30 miles. No pay increases were given to musicians or leadership.

New this year: the Park District is installing 18 benches on a concrete pad in front of the bandshell, funded entirely by an anonymous private donor. The benches will be removable for events like the Petunia Festival. Hammett credited the donor's enthusiasm to the band's growing momentum and the city's visible investment in Page Park.

The band is also planning a collaboration with the Dixon High School band. Two DHS seniors — Blake Ferguson and James Kocar — were highlighted as all-state musicians who have played with the municipal band.

On fundraising, the band conservatively budgets $25,900 in private contributions but has consistently exceeded that, bringing in $30,000–$33,000 annually. Hammett said he deliberately keeps the projection low so the band's core operations don't depend on donations.

The upcoming spring concert on March 28 will feature internationally known musician Tom Scott, who will also lead a free clinic for area students.

### Arts and Culture Fund

The fund holds $203,234 with no ongoing revenue source. City Manager Danny Langloss noted the fund carries placeholder budget lines and that the Dixon Chamber's arts and culture committee directs proposals to the council for approval. No major new spending was outlined.

### Community Development Fund

This fund holds $950,585 in cash, plus a $500,000 inter-fund loan made for the 65-acre property purchase behind Walmart (to be repaid eventually). Key items:

- **Housing Revitalization Program:** $163,748 budgeted (down from $200,000 last year after Strong Communities Grant spending). The council can reset it to $200,000 if desired.
- **Dixon Historic Theater:** A $200,000 request is pending. Staff plans to meet with theater representatives to review financials before bringing it to the council.
- **IMPACT Program:** $25,000, part of a multi-year commitment.
- **Municipal Band transfer:** $40,000 from this fund supports the band budget.

Langloss cautioned that with no stable funding source, the fund will dwindle if current spending levels continue. He noted the city cannot contribute additional money this year due to competing capital needs, particularly the seawall project.

### Capital Improvement Projects — Administrative

- **DIMCO Property Cleanup:** $1.175 million (mostly grant-funded).
- **Viaduct Point Future Development:** $550,000 from recovery funds.
- **Gateway Project Closeout:** $100,000.
- **TIF Demolition (former Moxie building area):** $865,000. Plans are complete; demolition awaits TIF eligibility confirmation.
- **Bridge/Viaduct Point Project:** $9.5 million, of which $9.1 million is grant-funded. The city leveraged a $4.61 million local investment against nearly $12 million in state RAISE grant funds. The city's estimated share of the $16.9 million project is roughly $390,000. The 30-year project is 75–80% complete.

### Capital Improvement Projects — Infrastructure

- **Arch Bridge Improvements (1st, 2nd, 3rd Street viaducts):** $300,000 from the half-percent infrastructure fund. Structures are sound but need cosmetic/historic restoration. West 2nd Street goes first, with bids expected soon.
- **Bloody Gulch Park:** $3 million total ($2 million from a federal grant via Congressman LaHood). Will include stormwater detention, recreational space, and eventually a pedestrian pathway connecting to the Gateway area. Full buildout could reach $6–8 million over multiple phases. Some funding will come from dollars previously earmarked for the now-unnecessary Project Rock.
- **Engineering:** $75,000 annual allocation for developer infrastructure oversight.
- **Fargo Creek Culvert Replacement:** $1.75 million from the Fargo Creek TIF for deteriorating culverts at 5th/Monroe and 9th/Monroe, plus retaining walls. Langloss noted the TIF doesn't yet have sufficient funds, so the city will need to loan itself money from former Project Rock allocations. He's pursuing federal grant possibilities with Congressman LaHood's office.
- **South Galena Avenue Paving Closeout:** $80,000 from MFT for IDOT reimbursement of relocated city infrastructure.
- **ITEP East Path Extension:** $2.85 million ($2.25 million grant-funded) to extend the riverfront path east to Raynor.
- **Riverfront Seawall Repair:** $700,000 from FY25 turn-ins. A 2025 inspection of roughly 240 feet of south bank seawall east of the Galena Avenue bridge found structural deficiencies including erosion and voids. Some sections may need complete replacement, including the sidewalk above. Staff plans to move quickly once the budget is finalized.
- **Sidewalk Improvement Program:** $100,000 from the infrastructure fund, to be bundled with the resurfacing bid for better pricing.
- **Street Resurfacing:** $2.1 million ($1.4 million from the infrastructure fund, $700,000 from MFT). A preliminary street list has been sent to consultants with a target bid date in April.

### The Bottom Line

Dixon has an impressive pipeline of grant-funded projects, but city officials were candid about the financial pressures underneath. The Community Development Fund and capital reserves face competing demands with no new revenue streams identified. The seawall and Fargo Creek culverts represent urgent, unplanned expenses. The city's strategy of leveraging modest local dollars into large state and federal grants has worked well, but sustaining operations — the band, the theater, housing programs — will require the council to think carefully about long-term funding as one-time COVID-era money fades from the picture.

The next budget work session is Monday at 4 p.m., ahead of the regular council meeting.

I have four o'clock and I want to call
the special counsel
meeting of the Dixon
the Dixon City Council
to order for Wednesday
February 25th
roll call please
Councilman Bishop here
Councilman Considine here
Councilman Orris here
Councilman Veneer here
Mayor Hughes here
if we please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America
and to the republic
for which it stands
one nation
under God
indivisible
with liberty and justice for all
God bless these proceedings today
and
I don't believe we have anybody here
other than specific presentations
for
visitor or public comment
in which case
we will start with
move into the work session
for the 2026-2027 budget
and
I'll turn it over to
Mr. Langloss
Thank you Mayor and Council
night two
I will note that we have scheduled
another budget meeting
for this coming Monday at 4 p.m.
that would run from 4 to 5 30
right before the council meeting
for discussion
and so we would just ask for feedback
after today's session
I'm assuming you know we might need that time
but if we don't
and there's things that the council wants to do
with follow-up with department heads or myself
or Becky or Heather
and then schedule a meeting at a different time
for further discussion
we can do that as well
so just get some consensus from the council moving forward
but we'll get that posted
tonight we're going to go through
our human resources budget
as a reminder
this budget was peeled off in large part
there's a few new things in there
in large part from the administration budget
and tonight in the part-time
you're going to see a $40,000 placeholder
we've got some big projects coming up
on the HR side
that is just a placeholder
it would be for some of the other projects that are coming up on the HR side
that is just a placeholder
that is just a placeholder
for some specialized assistance on implementation
and there'll be further discussions about that
but we're not quite prepared to discuss that publicly yet tonight
so just to make a note on that
before we turn it over to now
and we're going to have IT
our band is here
a wonderful band
representation leadership is here
we'll talk at a high level
about the arts and culture community development fund
and then we'll go into our big CIP projects
as it relates to Rhodes major projects
and that met one of the mats
we'll see who lost the call
we'll see who lost the coin toss
we'll be walking us through that tonight
so without further ado
we will go ahead and turn it over
to our chief people officer Danelle
thanks Danny
thank you mayor
thank you council
so like Danny already said
a lot of what you're going to hear here
is stuff that we've already just really consolidated
into a new HR budget
that came from that general administration budget
if you have questions though
let me know as we go
I'll start with just the chief people officer salary
that was moved into the HR budget
also note that 10% of that is in the wastewater budget
and 10% of that is moved into the water budget as well
again that placeholder
that Danny was already talking about
is just that part-time temporary HR generalist position
for those key projects
so implementing the UKG platform
and having that knowledge there
as well as discussions for negotiations
that'll come in 2027
so having her there in place
for those types of the projects
again just that placeholder for it
as well as contractual cost
so those were updated to reflect an increase
in that UKG software expense
which we already discussed previously
in a previous meeting
dues and subscriptions
updated a little bit here
to reflect an increase in annual fees
just adding in a PHR certification
for the marketing manager
who currently already has that
so just keeping that in place for her
to use in the future
as well holding that certification
professional development and training
underneath there
we did increase to a sport
just supporting the attendance of conferences
holding the SHRM that I currently hold
so being able to
attend the SHRM conferences
IPOWER conferences
those types of things
for the continuing education
as well as
in addition it's the leadership training
awards and recognition
employee engagement program
those were all things that we did
all consolidated under that professional
and development
professional development and training piece
is where we have those housed into as well
those are covering
so the employee engagement program
is covering new hire materials
employee milestone recognitions
as well as the quarterly
all city luncheon
as far as the
sorry
the awards and recognition
those things were already there in the budget
and those were just consolidated
into the program
into the HR budget
and moved to that budget
any questions?
just
since your position is new
need to
the acronyms
SHRM
SHRM is a specific HR certification
so it's just
it's probably the most well known certification
there is for HR
specifically
oh boy
society of human rights
and human resources
um
management I believe is what it stands for
off the top of my head
in that
IPLRA
say that one more time
sorry
IPELRA
yeah
Illinois Public Employer Labor Relations Association
thank you Danny
okay
I just wanted the clarification
what the heck that meant
I'm sorry
I should have clarified that for you
so one of the things with the IPELRA conference
especially with approach and negotiations
is we will take a full team to that conference
and they will have
the latest arbitration
trends
what they're seeing in contracts
across all the different contracts
it's an area for us to get just like front and center
and aligned as a team
before we go into contract negotiations
which she said will begin
in a little less than a year
so we don't have a 26 budget
to compare to
you just said everything just kind of pushed over
so
go ahead Danny
yeah so Becky has sent some documents to the council
that shows from the administration budget
where things transferred over from
so there's
you know the the placeholder for part-time wages
is new
the
let me see here the contractual expense for UKG
is new
and then
I think we added about $8,000 to the budget
for professional development and training
and I will note that
with all of our department heads
you know the
the police chief has the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police
International Association of Chiefs of Police
the
when you go to the national training
the level of speakers and training you get
is significantly enhanced
because the local chapters
have a lot less funding and money
our fire chief goes to the International Association of Firefighters
annual conference
right
our office director has annual conferences they go to
and so we have allocated for that
there's a lot of
things when it comes to personnel
that you want to get right
and there's a lot of changes that have happened
especially at the federal level regarding this overtime
and tax on overtime very very confusing
so there's many issues that we need to make sure
that she's on the front edge of
as we move forward
thank you Danny
you're welcome
and I'll make sure that we get
we can get another printout for you Councilman Vanier
with some of those
because Becky kind of laid that out
as far as where things shifted from administration
and if you remember the administration
budget this year was
somewhere around 200,000 less than last year
Danny
yes
I laid that on the
each of their
for tonight's meeting
the document
perfect
thank you Becky
okay
there we go
thank you Becky
any other questions
everybody good
any other questions
thank you
thank you
thank you
we will be following back up with the Council
related to that placeholder as well
all right now we have Alan
good evening
I'll just kind of quickly run through these
I know there was some discussion on
some of the changes
and where they kind of fall in
so I'll kind of give you a good breakdown of those here
overall the budget's up about
$43,000
I believe it was $42,585
and going down through
the salary and medical insurance
and those are just the normal expenses
but starting with contractual expense
so this year it has $16,600
which was not there before
part of those were already spent
they were just allocated in other categories
so we've kind of moved those together
so the $1,600 that was in office supplies
got moved up there
$5,000 out of information technology
got moved up there
and the other $10,000 is new
and that's the contractual expense
$10,000 increase for the year
and that's just for additional support
for some high level projects as needed
that works out to about 60-65 hours of support
if we need it from the vendors
the next line is information technology
which you'll see is up about
$17,267
and that encompasses the other three major projects
that changed this year
the Civic Cassell going to the cloud
the Lee County GIS, ArcGIS
and firewall maintenance
those totaled $28,800
so there's about $11,000
that was actually decreased
$5,000 of it is what moved to the contractual
and then the other $6,000
was actually a reduction in cost
we were able to reduce some licenses
or change other things
that actually would have gone down by that much
if we didn't have these new projects
and then small tools and equipment
is up by $6,000 this year
and that is just due to the cost of equipment
especially right now
we have some hardware costs
that are just skyrocketing in some cases
and we were already getting short last year
because we didn't really raise our budget last year
for hardware
so that's new computers and phones and cameras
and all those kind of things
monitors
so it was just time for an increase there
because we were getting short this past year
and this next year is looking like
it's going to be really short if we stayed there
those are the major changes for this year
and I think that
unless there's any questions
we should get to the Q and A
thank you
let's ask him a real technical question
he can give us the tech answer
in a second
it's going to come out like chat GPT
other than the fact that
obviously a lot of the tech costs
even more than the standard rate of products.
I appreciate the effort into this one.
Yeah, the software costs see a pretty average increase.
That's kind of the normal inflation on those typically.
It was the hardware costs the past couple of years
we've seen some pretty major increases across the board,
and that's not unusual for computer stuff
for just about everybody lately.
Oh, I did have one more question,
and partly you clarified some of the confusion
by telling me where some of these categories
like firewall maintenance fit in.
But one of the things was that most of having been paid up front
for three years with the initial hardware purchase,
so what we're paying now, is that a three-year payment,
or is it a monthly payment?
I mean, excuse me, or an annual payment?
Sure, it's an annual payment.
So when we originally bought the equipment about three years ago,
it was roughly $50,000, probably in that neighborhood.
I don't have the exact number.
But that included three years,
or roughly $36,000 worth of the annual expense
was being paid up front.
And that was to get a better price,
because otherwise if we'd have done it annually,
it would have been more.
And then obviously the remainder was the hardware cost.
But yeah, we'll see this going forward now
for probably two years, and then in the third year,
the equipment will be getting six, seven years old,
and we'll see where it's at.
And maybe it's still supported at that point,
we can get another year out of it.
But if not, we'll probably have that initial replacement cost again.
And then at that point, we'll just have to see
if they have a three-year deal that we can get a better price on,
or if we just do an annual going forward from there.
It was just a better deal three years ago
to go with the three-year, so.
Thank you.
Thank you for that clarification.
Thank you, Alan.
Great job as always, sir.
I will say, and just reiterate,
it is impressive with all the different complex systems we have
that one person,
can stay on top of all of that.
And if you ever truly want to be freaked out,
if you got an issue on your city-issued computer,
you call Alan, and within like two seconds,
you see your mouse move in,
and he's right there fixing it immediately.
It's really incredible.
So thanks again, Alan.
All right, we have the municipal band.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening.
Trumpeteers.
Good evening.
I'm Chris Hammett, the business manager
of the Dixon Municipal Band, and this is?
John James, the director.
Our outstanding director, the maestro.
All right, so it's good to be here.
I'd like to kind of give a little recap
of what we've done in the last year.
It's been an outstanding year for your Dixon Municipal Band.
Since we were here last,
we had our spring concert to wrap up last year's season
with Greg Petillo, which was very well received.
The guy's a nut.
He beatboxed and played flute at the same time.
It was crazy.
The cool thing for Dixon, though,
was he did a clinic between our rehearsal on Saturday morning
and the performance on Saturday night,
and we had 25 area students come,
and he worked with them.
They brought their instruments,
and he spent a couple hours.
He worked with these kids, and it was fantastic.
So that's something new that we were able to do last year
with Greg.
Our guest this year is Tom Scott,
who's an amazing internationally-known musician,
and he's going to do the same thing.
So we've got a clinic scheduled with him
after our spring concert here on March 28th coming up.
So that was the last thing since we were here.
We represented the city in three parades last year,
St. Patrick's Day, Memorial Day,
and the Petunia Parade.
We had the Petunia Festival.
We had our summer season,
and there's a real synergy that's developing
between our band and its members and our audience.
Both are growing.
And as we look at the numbers up here,
that's kind of why some of these numbers
are bigger than what they were last year.
We typically have 45 members on stage during the summer.
This past year, we'd grown to 52,
and I'm budgeting for 55 this year.
So that's a lot of people coming to our shows.
We averaged 150 people at our shows
down at the band shell this year,
and that is up and continues to grow.
So more people are coming to the shows,
and more people want to come to Dixon and play in this band.
And that's why we're growing.
We're attracting musicians from the area,
and they're coming here with their families to see the show,
but they're coming here to practice as well on Monday nights.
And so I think that's a...
That's a really good thing for the band and for the city.
And it's a testament to John
for the work that he's doing with this band.
People want to come play with us and play for him.
The other thing that we've done this year
is try to add to our vendors to make that venue better
and make it more of an event for our audience.
We had an ice cream.
Royal Scoop ice cream was there
for all but one of our shows this year.
Main Squeeze was able to come down for a few,
and Christine's Kitchen.
So we've got ice cream, baked goods, and drinks.
And we're trying to hold on to that
and maybe expand the offerings that are there
on those Thursday nights.
So we're trying to make this more of an event
and continue to draw more people down there.
The other thing that we're looking forward to
as far as our summer concerts go,
obviously you're all familiar with the Bridge Project
and all the improvements that are happening in Page Park.
To go along with that,
the Park District is putting in a pad
in front of the band shell
that will have 18 six-foot benches
installed on a concrete pad.
And that will be there for this summer's events.
And we're very excited about that.
So just one more thing that we've tried to do
as one of our audience requests is
we're going to be doing a lot of things
to get better seating down here.
And some of our older folks,
the folks at Heritage Square,
they can't come with their own benches and stuff or chairs.
So we're trying to make it more accessible
to more of our audience.
And the Park District is doing that,
which we're really, really excited for.
Our Christmas concert was at the,
we're back at the Dixon Theater this past year.
Several of you were there for that concert.
It was extremely well-received.
The audience there,
like there's a synergy.
Between playing in the band and the crowd.
And we feel like we're throwing out really good music
and we get that acknowledgement.
The crowd at our Christmas concert was fantastic.
Feeling that energy in the theater was very gratifying
and made it, we just feed off each other, right?
That's how this is supposed to work.
That's what the arts are for.
And I feel like that we're accomplishing that
in our performances.
So thanks to those of you that were at that Christmas concert.
We were very happy with that.
Had some new music that went,
there too.
Like I said, we got our spring concert
coming up with Tom Scott.
Look him up.
He's amazing.
And if we want to hit some of these budget things
that are different,
like I said, I've budgeted more for personnel
because we under-budgeted.
We were about 5,000 over our budget after the summer
and I was a little panicked.
But we were able to cut some of that.
Some costs, Tom Scott came in less than what we had budgeted.
So most of that 5,000, we were able to make up there
with some of his travel expenses and that kind of stuff.
We were also able to cut a little bit of rehearsal time
at Christmas and we'll cut a little bit of rehearsal time
with spring in order to come in at budget this year.
But we would rather not do that.
So the budget this year reflects full cost
on a guest next spring.
As well as the cost for the full personnel.
I will say the other major thing
that we hadn't budgeted for in the past
and just kind of had as a piece of the personnel budget
was we pay a stipend for people who are traveling
more than 30 miles to come play for the band.
And like I said, we're attracting people.
We've got people coming over 90 miles each way
to come play in this band, which is phenomenal.
But we're paying them a little bit extra to do that.
And we're not employees, so we don't have to do
the tax thing, the IRS tax thing and all that.
But we do want to acknowledge that and pay a little extra
to those independent contractors who are coming
to play with us.
So I've accounted for that this year in the budget
and that also is a piece of why it's a little bit higher.
So I think last year, we're about 10,000 over what we were
last year as far as the overall budget.
Anything else, John?
Oh, you know, your music.
I'll talk about the music.
Okay.
I kind of forgot to mention, I've been in contact
with the high school band director, asked her opinion
of whether I would like to collaborate with the high school band
along with us.
And so we are trying to work something out.
I thought that might be of interest.
She seemed very excited about the idea.
And so at our last band meeting here downstairs,
we discussed a little bit about some of the logistics of how
we're going to get, you know, so we can maybe do a performance
together so the kids can kind of see, you know,
how the muni band people work and stuff too.
I just wanted to throw that out there,
something we're hoping to work on so we can, you know,
get a good relationship working with the high school band director.
Nice.
I like it.
Yeah.
Chris.
Yeah.
And the increasing contractual wages.
You've already indicated some of it's the stipend.
And we've got people coming from longer,
longer distances.
And so some of that, some of that stipend,
how much of it is cost of living increase?
In other words,
obviously the scale has got to be going up what we're paying the
musicians versus how much of it would be relative to increase in band
members that you're anticipating.
There is no increase in what is being paid to any of the director or
management.
There's no increase in what's being paid to any of the musicians.
It's strictly growth of the band and accounting for that,
that mileage stipend.
Okay.
And I think the growth of the band is,
is great,
but is there some anticipation of where you want to limit that size to or
how, what, how,
how much can you or do you want to,
how much do you want to control the growth because obviously one of the
biggest pieces of the increase this year is the increase in band members.
Correct.
That stage is only so big.
So that's where we're approaching the limit,
I would say for what we can do on the page park band shell stage.
Moving to the theater now for our indoor performances,
we can accommodate more people on there.
And, and I account for that.
In the budget.
We typically expand to about 65 or so when we're inside,
but outside,
I don't see us getting over 55.
Do you,
John,
I don't know where we put people.
It's yeah.
So you're kind of,
you're,
you might have a little bit more growth after this year,
but you're kind of getting to the,
your max.
We can't put many more people on that stage.
And I mean,
John can talk to and John and Kathy can talk more on the personnel side as to
how we treat people that want to come join us.
And we want to be as inclusive as we can and allow as many people to come
play as we can.
You want to hit that.
How that generally will work is given the instrumentation course,
you have all the different instruments.
And if you hit a section,
how I usually do it as director,
somebody comes to me and says,
you know,
we really want to play the band.
I play this.
We might be capped out at that particular instrument.
That's where we start cooling it down.
If it's an instrument we need,
you know, that's where we adjust.
But yeah,
we will hit a cap at some point where it's just,
you know,
no,
I have turned people away.
We just simply don't need any more of that particular instrument when we hit a certain
cap.
And we're,
he's right.
We're about there.
I mean,
you might get 60 on that stage,
but that'd be pretty snug.
Yeah.
I've been there enough times,
especially the percussion is trying to move around the back,
switch positions.
All right.
Anybody else have any questions?
So the part-time salary line item is,
is that
that's John.
Yes.
That's strictly John.
John's the only employee of the city part-time employee for the band.
All the rest of us are independent contractors.
Okay.
So guest artist costs are built in where
the way it transfers onto that budget,
a piece of it is contractual wage.
Okay.
And then there's a piece of it,
I believe that goes into the mileage and travel.
I believe that 2000 for mileage and travel is all to get the guest artist here in home.
And in contractual wages,
I will say 5,000 of that is set aside to hire somebody to come play with us.
Okay.
So about 5,000 guest artists.
So about seven total is allocated to get somebody to come and play with us.
Okay.
Tom Scott.
I'd like,
I have one.
First of all,
I want to say thank you for the extremely wonderful work that your organization has
done over the past few years.
I recall when it was a battle Royal to think we were going to keep a band and here we are
whistling and Dixie.
Now it's ours.
I think it's a happy,
happy place.
I hope you get a hundred people want to come.
My other question is,
how do you determine,
how do you determine the profile of the young people that want to play in those workshops?
And how,
how do you determine who you bring into it and how many are you allowed to have?
You're talking about the workshop with the guest artist?
Correct.
That's open.
What we,
what we've done is we send letters out to all,
all area schools,
but certainly I think,
I believe Dixon's maybe even has something hanging up in their band or about it.
It's open to anybody.
Cause it means it's,
we do it at the auditorium.
Right there,
you know,
after our rehearsal in the morning,
I don't know,
there might be a little bit of a gap,
but then,
yeah,
they come in sometime in the afternoon.
I won't,
I want to say,
I don't recall the time off the top of my head,
but,
and it's open to whoever can get there.
Okay.
You know,
I mean,
it's usually,
it's a,
what are they doing on that Saturday?
That's the tricky part,
you know,
cause they're out of school and families are traveling and all that.
So,
you know,
but we had people all the way from Rockford,
parents bring their kids down from Rockford last year.
And several from Dixon,
most from Dixon,
but I think some from Sterling came over,
but.
All right.
Thank you.
Speaking of the kids,
can I brag on two of them?
We have two kids at the high school.
They're both seniors this year.
I call them kids.
But Blake Ferguson,
Allen and James Kocar are seniors at Dixon high school that played in our band.
They played all four years in high school.
They both made all state this year.
They both sat first chair.
They both,
you know,
they both,
you know,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,

they both,
they both,
They both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
They both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
they both,
maintain that and you know add use that to supplement what you're getting from
the city but the last couple of years actually even the last four years you've
been you've been higher than what you've got in your existing budget for
contribution and 25 actual was thirty three five fifty five almost eight
thousand above what you've got projected for this next year and I know there's
been some pretty good interest in in that contribution income how what
particular reason are you keeping that down are you referring to what we're
able to raise ourselves yeah okay what's the number that's there for
that
it's 25 9 25 9 okay okay we have 74 firms or families that contribute to us
that has been anywhere from 25 to 33,000 over the last couple of years we never
know exactly how that how much that's going to be so far I think for this year
we're only going to have a little bit more than that but I think we're going to
we're going to have a little bit more than that but I think we're going to
we're going to have a little bit more than that but I think we're going to
around 26 I think we're just under 30 somewhere in that range so I just try
around 26 I think we're just under 30 somewhere in that range so I just try
to be conservative because I don't know how much is actually going to come in we
to be conservative because I don't know how much is actually going to come in we
will continue to do our fundraising we will continue to do our ask for that
will continue to do our fundraising we will continue to do our ask for that
patron sponsor program but I don't want the core things that we're expected to
patron sponsor program but I don't want the core things that we're expected to
do to have to rely on that that that's the reason there I want to be
do to have to rely on that that that's the reason there I want to be
conservative with that number and conservative with that number and I want to
So now I'm actually starting to work together with a bigger plan now for a
and not have the summer concert series and that Christmas show be reliant on are we going to get the money from from the
Fundraiser or are we not?
So you're
26
Year to date
Let's go 25 was 33 555. Did you also put?
25,000 as your budgeted amount in 2025 I
Don't recall what I had last year
It doesn't yeah, it doesn't show but because that seems like 20 26 this past year was budgeted at 25 as well
Okay, so there you go. Okay, so you you've exceeded your
Budgeted amount seems like every year. Yes. Yeah, gotcha. That's the goal
That's always the great accounting. Good job. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, we want to be in the black. Yes
Yes, so the project you were talking about the seats. Yes. Those are at the band shell
They will be
Removable
Yes for Petunia Festival. Yes
How did that come about?
It's been something that we've heard and Dwayne's heard at the Park District about having seating there
And so Dwayne and I got together we went down and looked at it
I went to Mount Morris and and Sterling and we're like, okay, what what makes sense here for Dixon and
and some discussions with Dwayne
We went down there looked at it kind of walked it off and he sent me some benches
He's like, what do you like we we kind of did that stuff?
we came up with a plan to do a capital campaign to to raise the money to do that and
I'd had somebody reach out to me previously
Saying that if there was capital needs for the band that they didn't want to be part of the you know
Just operational stuff that we do
But if there was something
That
We needed they'd be willing to do something so without throwing a number so I it
Before we started the capital campaign, which would have been, you know, twenty seven thirty thousand dollars to do this
I
Reached that back out and said hey, would you you know be interested in this and they said well
We'll call you back and 20 minutes later. They called back and said that they would
fund it so
Then Dwayne and I were scrambling
It's like oh we got a yes
We don't have to do a capital campaign. And so, you know, they've made their
Donation to to the Park District Dwayne was able to get the number down because he was ordering all of them through the Park District at
once and
They're anonymous we don't have to put little tags or things on them. So that was an expense that we were able to take off
Dwayne was able to talk to whoever he talks to for concrete
and
Say yes
this is a go give me a firm number and
we were able to go back to the donor and cut it from one number down to what we actually needed and
Yeah done deal really excited about it, but talk to him, you know, when we went down there it was, you know
Petunia Festival uses that and
We can't have permanent benches there because they need to set up the tilt-a-whirl, right?
so
You know talked about how's that gonna work? And so they agree they'd
They put them in there they can put them in so that they come back out and yeah, yeah
Yeah, so yeah, it was it was Dwayne really
being able to
to make that work and and we were able to
Help him do it. So
It's a great project and with and and it was it it was easy to talk to the donors about because of
the success that they've seen with a band and
And what the city's doing with that bridge project and what's happening all through Page Park
You say okay you you see what we're doing
You see what the city's doing you'll be a part of that and put put these benches in and they're like, yeah
we'd like to do that we want to be a part of it and
It's just it's that working together and with the park district coming in. It's it's everybody working together and it's just so cool
It's phenomenal
what what happens when everybody's working together and
Making these successes happen. So, yeah
Excellent. Thank you again. Thank you. Anybody else have any questions? Appreciate it. Thank you very much. It's doing a great job
Since 1918
We've had a municipal band in the city of Dixon, yeah
Used to be a lot of cold
And thanks for your extra work
Trying to put it all together finally
It needed it. I agree. You say you were at that first concert
You're a lucky man John, thank you guys the LA Express
Great presentation
All right now I'm gonna talk about the arts and culture
and the Community Development Fund
quickly
for the council's knowledge the cash balance of the arts and culture fund is two hundred and three thousand two hundred and thirty four dollars
Two hundred and three thousand two hundred and thirty four dollars. Look at that after added to draft document
So you have that in the narratives?
so as a reminder of the arts and culture fund
There are some
heighten restrictions and limitations on the spending of money from this fund
Dixon camera Chamber of Commerce and Main Street runs their arts and culture
committee they're constantly looking at ways to enhance Dixon in that way mural
sidewalk murals painting of fire hydrants the list kind of goes on and
on but it's got to be arts and culture related the committee makes
recommendations to the City Council the City Council whether it's $1 or five
thousand dollars has to hear any expenditure request and then it has to
approve by a majority vote and so what we see in the budget this year is really
just to carry over of placeholders and this budget I'm not sure exactly where
discover Dixon is that what the mural program I know that's come before the
Council and they're selecting some things
you're right I think they would think that would be part of it maybe they're
probably going in this one an area known as the City Council in this country
I'm not up to speed if that'll happen this spring or if that'll happen this summer and when that'll come out.
But this budget really has just placeholder carryovers, you know, other contractual, small equipment and tools, donation expense, other expense.
So, yeah, that's sad at a high level.
Again, there's no continued funding source for this right now.
We're not putting additional money into it right now.
And that fund before any expenditures is $203,234.
So if there's no questions on that, the Community Development Fund.
So the cash balance of the Community Development Fund, which is in the narrative, is $950,585.
That's before any expenditures this coming year.
I don't think there's any more expenditures.
What's expected this year?
All right, maybe some for the Strong Community Grant, which I'll talk about in just a second.
As a reminder, this fund, in addition to the $950,000 in cash, has made a $500,000 inter-fund loan for the purchase of the 65 acres located behind Walmart.
So that money will come back.
It won't come back for a couple of years.
But that money will come back eventually.
It will come back eventually into this fund.
So types of things that are in this fund.
First, Strong Communities Grant.
So we have a housing revitalization program.
Last year was budgeted at $200,000.
What we were able to do with that program this year was through the Strong Communities Grant.
So there was some local match.
And so that's why you see the 163,748 number.
So the difference between $200,000 and that number is what we've spent towards that grant.
I will say that if the council wants to just reset that to $200,000, we certainly can do that.
And the number is just the way it's shown right here.
And I think what the discussion was last year, you can correct me if you have a different memory on it,
was that we would probably try to roll out a program and see what $100,000 looked like for that program
and then kind of revisit the next.
And so that still is a program we're wanting to get off the ground.
There's quite a bit that goes with it.
But we have made some good progress.
We've made some good progress with Strong Communities this year.
And there will be a continued focus to get our full housing revitalization program off the ground.
Probably discussions and planning still yet this spring and then execution in the next budget year.
So just to say it one more time, we could take that number back to $200,000 if the council desired.
Or we could leave it at the $163,000.
So then we have a look at Donations.
So we have a $200,000 request from the Dixon Historic Theater.
It's my understanding we're waiting on some more data and information.
I will be contacting Spencer to set up a meeting with him and whoever he would like to bring to sit with our executive committee
to dive into those numbers a little bit deeper and understand that a little more.
Then we have the impact program for $25,000.
That's a multi-year commitment.
It appeared before the council last year.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
It's a multi-year commitment.
If the council would like the impact program or WAC CEO to appear before them, we can make that happen
Over the next month.
Staff didn't feel like it was necessary.
prerogative and from this fund there is a forty thousand dollar transfer to the band which is the
funding source that is currently being used to support the band's budget that they just presented
on happy to take any questions the funding source for this budget funding yeah so funding source
you know initially funding came from the covid relief fund and that those that were expended on
police and fire salaries and so we had surplus and unexpended expenses and so that was originally
what created this i believe i'm not exactly positive that you know our turn-ins were much
higher in prior years and we've been able to allocate a little more money to this fund
we don't believe we're able to do that this year based on the competing needs and
end-to-end costs of the fund so we're not able to do that this year based on
the competing needs and end-to-end costs of the fund so we're not able to do that this year based on
interest of the capital fund in the seawall which I believe you will hear about in a few minutes
so there is no stable funding source for this so it is just something for us to keep in mind
when we're looking at longer term support of programming um you know the theater for example
and it's been amazing it looks amazing the programming is up all those things at 200,000
a year every year you know this budget will go will go quickly um that's not a plug for or against
the 200,000 contribution this year it's just a statement and then presumably with the band
being treated as a as an apartment within the city you know is is this fund dwindles and we'll
be looking at other funding sources in our working gateway related to sales tax creation and
enhancement throughout the entire city is not over it is just beginning
and so
um
we'll need to do those things to stay ahead of the curve what scenarios might we see that
that could be funding sources here yeah honestly right now um we're trying to figure out a funding
source for the capital fund so I think continued growth and revenues potential grant and grant
matching opportunities so I think you know the one thing that we want to be conscious of and
point to the council is that you know the the fund balance is you know one
point four million and you know we just got to think long term about what we can sustain or not sustain you know obviously if we sustain all the requests this year our fund balance is still good but that will begin to dwindle you know quickly and unfortunately we did have a little lightened load of requests this year you know that come from this fund
yeah and any you know thoughts ideas I mean that's that's the one thing that's a big focus
created some draft documents looking at the capital fund and some of these other things
and um this fund remains healthy but it's just something we need to think about thank you yeah
thank you all right if there are no other questions we will uh do a rock paper scissors
contest for which matt will come to the podium oh I think they already did I guess there's a
delegation that's occurred
I lost I lost the coin flip this time so
Mr. Matt Hewitt thank you Danny okay so I'm going to be starting with the administrative CIP
these are primarily carryover projects uh that really focused on the continued redevelopment of
the viaduct point area with the exception of the gateway project first up is the dimco property
which represents the final cleanup efforts
at the dimco site funding for this project includes $768,000 from a brownfields grant
that we were awarded back in 2023 with the remaining $407,000 funded through the riverfront
tiff project cost of $1.175 million dollars next up is future development we budgeted $550,000 from recovery funds
to support future economic development down in the viaduct point area
this includes things like property acquisition and site readiness
we have budgeted $100,000 to the gateway project to address any remaining closeout costs or punchless
items $865,000 budgeted on tiff demolition remediation of the former
and finally $9.5 million is budgeted to complete project $9.1 million of that coming from grant funds
the city was awarded a $4.61 million local
compliments to nearly $12 million raise grant that we were awarded for the project as a result the
city's estimated local share of this $16.9 million project is roughly $390,000
to just over 35 but the history of the 30-year project is roughly 75 to 80 percent complete
intended so
and that is it for the admin cip happy to take any questions
as far as teardown goes i know that's a working process do we think some of that stuff's gonna...
the Scale now you're talking about the moxie building
yeah so the plans are complete we're kind of waiting with a few minutes on that
info with the TIF eligibility of the area at this point.
Once we have that, I think we'll move forward
pretty quickly with the actual tear down. Have we
updated our estimates or have we on the tear down on that building?
Yeah, I don't remember what it was.
They were definitely updated
just for inflationary costs. We kind of went back and just looked at things
and updated the numbers as we
could best do without having actual numbers.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, so next up is the
infrastructure CIP. And these projects are funded by
multiple funding sources. Some of these are the
half a percent infrastructure fund, MFT funds,
grant funding, TIF dollars, and turn-ins.
The first item is the arch bridge improvements.
These are the railroad viaducts at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Street
based on inspections completed in 2024.
We found that these are all structurally sound but do need some
cosmetic repairs. And because these arches are
on the historic registry, there are very specific restoration processes
that we must follow. We budgeted
$300,000 from the half a percent infrastructure fund for this project
and we hope to be out to bid within the next couple of months
for the West 2nd Street arch. That'll be our first
one.
Next, we have budgeted $3 million for the creation of Bloody Ghost Park.
This project focuses on
creating a recreational park just south of Bloody Ghost
Road and also constructing a stormwater detention
area west of the Gateway project. We were fortunate
enough to be awarded a $2 million grant in 2025 for this project
with the additional funding coming from FY23 turn-ins.
The next item is engineering. This is a $75,000
annual allocation.
This funding supports developer-related infrastructure
installation that the city will ultimately assume ownership of.
It covers things like plan reviews, construction
observation, material verification, things like that.
Ultimately, when we take over this infrastructure,
we want to have a quality product. And this also
supports any engineering costs that may pop up over the course of the year.
So we have budgeted
$1.75 million from the Fargo Creek
TIF for the Fargo Creek culvert replacement project.
This project is critical for maintaining stormwater control
throughout Fargo Creek. The project includes
replacement of deteriorating culverts at
5th and Monroe and 9th and Monroe. And we will also be adding some
retaining walls to address some erosion issues in that area.
We have budgeted
$80,000 from MFT to address closeout costs for the
South Galena Avenue paving project. This was an
IDOT-funded project, but the city is responsible for reimbursing
IDOT for the relocation of city infrastructure tied to the project.
So that would include things like water valves and
manholes, stuff of that nature.
Next, we have budgeted
$2.85 million for the ITEP east path,
which will extend the current path along the river east to
Raynor. We were awarded a $2.25 million
ITEP grant a few years back for this project, with the
remaining funding coming from recovery funds previously
approved by council.
We have budgeted $700,000 for the
riverfront seawall project.
This will come from FY25 turn-ins. So this is
based on a structural inspection that we did in 2025
of roughly 240 feet of south bank seawall.
So it would be just east
of the Galena Avenue bridge and just west of the hydro plant,
so that area there. The inspection did identify some areas of
concern that will require some rehabilitation
or actual replacement of sections of the wall, and also included
in that is the sidewalk above the wall.
You know, this project is critical in preserving
the structural integrity of the wall, as well as
preventing further erosion in the area.
We have budgeted $100,000 from the half a percent infrastructure fund
for the sidewalk improvement program. This program was used
to construct the sidewalk out on Low Park Road last
year, much needed. This project
will be included in this year's resurfacing bid package. We feel like
throwing this in with a larger project will result in better pricing for us.
And finally is our annual street resurfacing
program. We have $2.1 million budgeted for this. $2.2 if you
count the sidewalk improvement program.
$1.4 million will come from the half a percent infrastructure fund.
And another $700,000 will come from MFT funds.
We have provided a preliminary list of
streets and sidewalk locations to our consultants with the hopes
to have this out to bid in April of this year.
And that is it for the infrastructure
CIP. Thank you. A couple of
things to note. Buddy Gulch Park,
we won a $2 million grant from Congressman LaHood. We expect to be doing
the final paperwork for that.
The full build out of the retention
that will significantly slow down the water that's heading towards
Fargo Creek on that side, which was an original significant
factor in the creation of the Fargo Creek TIF.
Preliminary numbers showed that full build out
could be anywhere between $6 and $8 million. And so we're
looking at taking that in phases. Additionally, there will be a pathway
pedestrian pathway that will end up
joining our current pathway that
ends at 7th Street that's heading south from our new bridge.
You'll take the roadway. It'll be designated up over the tracks down into
Pirips Landing. And there'll be a pathway that runs up through Buddy Gulch
Park and connects to the gateway. That's projected
right now at $3 million. We're currently getting ready to apply for a couple more
grants. That park will come to life
over a period of time. One of the
things that we're recommending is using
a portion of the money that we had
dedicated to Project Rock
as a funding source. That funding source that he talked about was
previously designated to Project Rock.
Second thing, the Fargo Creek culverts. I do have a call with
Congress of Middlehood tomorrow because the next round of grants are coming out.
And I'm going to see if the seawall or if these culverts
qualify under that grant and that build out and continuation
of what we're trying to do. But that
$1.75 million isn't something that we've been
projecting for any period of time.
They're in very bad
shape. We don't want to get into a situation where they fail and we have the
situation we had on 7th Street 10 years ago. And then it costs double
to deal with. So that is in the TIF.
Flood remediation and that being a big part of that is a foundational issue and why that TIF
was created. And so the funding source is the TIF.
But the TIF doesn't have any money yet. It's got some but not a lot.
So we will need to loan ourselves money
from money that was already designated to
pay for Project Rock that we no longer have to designate to Project
Rock to cover that project. And then the seawall, again,
another project that's essential so we don't lose our parking lot at River and Galena
into the water is, you know, that's where the
$700,000 recommendation from FY25 turn-ins comes from.
So a couple things that I don't know that you
can just predict. I don't know that you can just predict. I don't know that you can just predict.
But I wanted to showcase those projects.
You know, even though we won that additional grant
and that's relieved some funding, it isn't like we're sitting around
you know, picking what we're going to do with a couple million dollars.
So I wanted to just really drive home some deeper information on that
for the council.
That riverfront seawall repair project, Matt,
so we've had some engineering work done already. Yeah, back in
May of 25, we had Willa Hoffman went and did
a structural inspection of it and, yeah, found some
deficiencies, like Danny said. I mean, it's not to that point yet, but
it will get there if we don't do anything.
So will there be, like, aesthetic changes as well, or
will it be... There will be...
Final plans aren't drawn up yet, but just according to the report,
there does need to be probably
some of the wall completely redone and some of it maybe rehabbed.
I know the sidewalk, there are some options with replacement or mud jacking,
something to fill some of the voids in there. So we'll
know more as we dig deeper into the weeds, but, you know,
we did receive a cost estimate, you know, what they thought it would cost.
It's hard to predict these things, especially when you're working in the water, so we think
we've got a good number, but, you know, we'll see as we move forward.
Is there a timeline on this project yet?
We'll probably, as soon as this budget season wraps up, we'll start moving forward
with it. I mean, this is a critical project, I think.
You know, we want to... There's already some erosion taking place.
There's voids and spots in the area, so I think
we're going to move pretty quickly.
We want to make sure we make it fisherman friendly as well.
Okay. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Some of that, as we move
to the west, is not so much. Sure. Thank you.
Any other questions from the council on this?
Again, a lot of projects, a lot of things that we've seen in the past.
Definitely encourage you to, you know, let me know if you have additional
questions, you know, contact the MATS to get further information on the projects.
If there's anything you're unsure about, they've got a pretty good handle on it.
So that concludes the
formal part of the budget presentation.
Every department, capital budgets,
infrastructure budgets, we've had, you know,
some not-for-profits appear before the council.
So certainly a lot of information for the council to take in.
Fortunately, a lot of it's pretty familiar information from the last
several years. We haven't decided to go to Mars yet,
so, you know, it's pretty straightforward in, you know, what it is
we're working on. So happy to, if you guys want to have any
conversation, if, you know, like I said, for the next meeting we have set on
on Monday, if you have any questions for me, Becky, Heather are here, the MATS
are here. You know, anything that's on your mind or anything you want to say,
hey, we'd like a little more information on this. Can we prep that for Monday? Absolutely.
Is there anything else for discussion?
Anything else that needs to be addressed tonight or brought up?
Hearing none and having completed all
items on the agenda, we're adjourned.
