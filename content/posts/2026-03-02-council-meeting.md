# Dixon City Council Special Meeting Summary
## February 23, 2025 — Budget Work Session

**The Bottom Line:** City staff presented the fiscal year 2027 budget (May 1, 2025–April 30, 2026) to the council. Despite adding roughly $560,000 in new revenue from Gateway development sales tax and hotel/motel tax growth, the city projects a surplus of just $68,000 — a razor-thin margin driven by a 20% health insurance increase and public safety pension payments now exceeding $3 million annually.

### Key Financial Picture

City Manager Danny Langloss framed this as a "budget kickoff" with final approval expected in about six weeks. Two cost pressures dominate: health insurance (up 20% for the coming year, though the city's membership in a joint insurance pool spared it from the 45% hikes some communities face) and combined police/fire pension payments, which rose $188,000 this year. The city issued pension bonds in 2023 and can look at refinancing at year seven.

Finance Director Becky Leslie — presenting her final budget before retiring in June — walked through revenue projections. The state's "clawback" of overpaid CPPRT funds appears to be over, allowing a $250,000 increase in that line. Sales tax is up $300,000 thanks to the Gateway corridor. Income tax is budgeted flat as a hedge against possible state action to freeze municipal shares. Gaming tax and landfill revenue each rise $50,000, though Leslie flagged landfill revenue as potentially "extinct" if the Lee County landfill reaches capacity.

Hotel/motel tax has jumped from $65,000 a few years ago to a budgeted $300,000 — a figure Leslie said she "never would have dreamed about."

On the expense side, Leslie noted that roughly 75% of the general fund is payroll. She praised department heads for holding operational costs flat year over year but warned that Fund 31 — the general capital fund used for squad cars, dump trucks, and equipment — has no dedicated funding source and relies on year-end "turn-ins" (surplus funds) that are declining. Turn-ins were once above $3 million; the city now projects them at roughly $2.2 million and trending toward $1.5 million or less.

Real estate tax levy lines are zeroed out this year. The city had to levy for Social Security ($250,000), and remaining levy capacity was absorbed by pension obligations.

### Department-by-Department Highlights

**Administration/HR/Marketing:** The admin budget dropped nearly 21%, but that's mostly a bookkeeping reorganization — the marketing coordinator position shifted to a new PR/Marketing budget, and several line items moved into a new standalone Human Resources department. Actual spending is roughly flat.

**City Council Operations:** A $15,000 placeholder was added to explore software for handling Freedom of Information Act requests. The city is being "absolutely hammered" by FOIAs, many believed to be generated by bots, and police body camera footage requires labor-intensive redaction. The alternative would be hiring another staff person.

**Economic Development:** Flat budget. The Lee County Industrial Development Association payment ($10,000) was moved here from the marketing budget, which accounts for the apparent increase.

**Fire Department (Chief Busco):** The emergency vehicle fund projects $1.25 million in ambulance service revenue. A new ambulance ordered in May 2024 ($325,000) should arrive during the fiscal year. The department is gradually transitioning to Starcom radios — a regional interoperability system — buying roughly five per year starting with officers. A joint training facility with Dixon Rural Fire is in the works; the budget includes the city's half of the estimated cost, still being finalized. New lighter-weight protective gear will be purchased to extend the life of structural turnout gear. A firefighter's potential military deployment starting in October will create staffing pressure reflected in a 41% overtime increase placeholder.

**Police Department (Chief Bivens):** The department's first budget under new leadership shows a 7.86% overall increase ($361,000), with over $300,000 of that in contractual obligations (salary, benefits, dispatch contract). Notable additions:
- Full conversion to Starcom radios: $410,000
- A side-by-side utility vehicle for community events and hard-to-reach areas
- Cell phones in every squad car (for calls and evidence photos)
- Ballistic shields for all squads (currently only some have them)
- Replacement of expired gas masks
- New investigative software (CellBrite upgrade, Leads Online, Nighthawk)
- A $13,000 placeholder for a community-facing department app
- A placeholder for a possible additional administrative assistant — a position that previously existed — partly to address FOIA workload

The council was asked to consider whether to revive the downtown Community Service Officer position (vacant 3-4 years, $18,000 budgeted). No decision was requested immediately.

**Streets (Tyler, Public Works):** Operating budget up 5.24%, mostly wages and insurance. Capital requests total $805,000, headlined by a $360,000 street sweeper to replace a 2008 model, $150,000 for downtown bollards and barriers (includes $80,000 carryover), $140,000 for a dump truck already in production, $130,000 to finish the Cline Avenue streetlight project, and $25,000 to continue LED conversions.

Over the past eight years, the city has resurfaced 40% of its streets — $15.7 million in infrastructure investment.

**Properties:** Operating budget actually decreases 3.23%. Capital requests of $435,000 include $140,000 for City Hall's north wall (water infiltration problems stemming from the building's original design, which assumed an adjacent structure would shield it), $100,000 for the Chamber/Main Street building roof, $65,000 for a truck, $50,000 for riverfront fountain plumbing repairs, $40,000 for Christmas decorations along the new pedestrian bridge path, and $15,000 for riverfront table replacement. Councilman Considine raised the cost of repairing the recently vandalized Berlin Wall memorial; staff said they're still assessing.

**Cemetery:** Up 3.25%. Capital includes a $65,000 pickup truck, a $50,000 columbarium (above-ground cremation niche structure — a first for Oakwood Cemetery and expected to generate revenue), and $30,000 to begin engineering assessment of the aging mausoleum, with $300,000 penciled in for FY28 repairs.

**Airport:** Most capital costs are 90-95% reimbursed by federal and state funds. Projects include runway rehabilitation (carryover), a new weather system (carryover), $40,000 in hangar roof/fascia repairs (local funds only), and terminal building modernization for ADA compliance. The city's local share is $20,000, transferred from the general fund. The airport otherwise sustains itself on hangar rentals, farmland lease income, and fuel sales.

**Water Department:** Metered sales are recovering to pre-COVID levels. The 2.5% annual rate increase continues. Capital highlights: $550,000 for Water Tower #9 rehabilitation (full blast, repaint, 25-year service life expected), $75,000 to continue the Factory/West 9th Street water main project, $70,000 for deteriorating filter pipes at the main plant (with similar failures showing at wells — expect this line item for several years), and a $60,000 truck replacement. Cameron Magni was introduced as the incoming water manager following Matt Heckman's summer retirement.

**Wastewater:** After a four-year rate freeze, the 2.5% user fee increase resumes. Operating costs up 5.85%. All capital items are carryovers: a Morton-style equipment building in design, the Purity Mills lift station in design, a roll-off truck being outfitted at Bonnell's, and the major $25 million treatment plant overhaul (construction has begun but winter slowed progress; target completion December 2027). EPA loan forgiveness is being pursued.

### Major Projects and Planning

- **Gateway Corridor** continues to produce results: OSF Healthcare and Tropical Smoothie Cafe are moving into the multi-tenant building, with other tenants not yet public.
- **Housing** remains a top priority. Washington Park single-family development is over half full. Craig Wilson's company built 24-32 new apartment units on Middle Road. The city continues exploring workforce and 55+ housing.
- **Viaduct Point** (between the Peoria Avenue bridge and pedestrian bridge) visioning continues, with possible demolition of the old Knack building and junkyard property this year.
- **Bloody Gulch Park** received a $2 million federal grant for regional stormwater retention, ponds, fishing, and pathway — connecting the trail system to the Route 88 corridor and eventually to Sauk Valley Community College.
- **Project Rock** (pathways and Page Park improvements) is ahead of schedule, with a grand opening/250th anniversary celebration planned for July 4th.
- **Comprehensive Plan** led by Mayor Hughes has been completed after extensive public engagement.

### What to Watch

The council meets Wednesday to continue budget review, including the human resources budget, a one-time records management expense, and a roughly $700,000 seawall repair project described as essential. Staff is also analyzing whether to begin financing long-lived equipment purchases rather than paying cash, as the capital fund's revenue stream shrinks. The final budget is expected for approval in approximately six weeks.

Councilwoman Oros reminded everyone — and the public — that the city's policy is to buy vehicles locally, through an agreement with Ken Nelson that allows a set premium over state bid pricing.
