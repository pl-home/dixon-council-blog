# Dixon City Council Special Meeting Summary — February 23, 2025

## Budget Season Kicks Off

The Dixon City Council held a special work session to begin reviewing the proposed fiscal year 2027 budget, which will run from May 1, 2025, through April 30, 2026. City Manager Danny Langloss led the presentation, with department heads walking the council through their individual budgets. Here's what citizens should know.

---

## The Big Picture

The city projects finishing just **$68,000 in the black** — a razor-thin margin that underscores a key reality: even with $560,000 in new revenue from economic development (Gateway corridor sales tax and hotel/motel tax growth), rising costs are consuming nearly all of it.

**Two major cost drivers** are squeezing the budget:
- **Health insurance**, up 20% through the city's insurance pool (communities outside the pool are seeing 45% increases)
- **Public safety pensions**, now exceeding **$3 million annually** in combined police and fire payments, up $188,000 this year

The city drew pension bonds in 2023 and can look at refinancing at the seven-year mark — something staff says they're tracking.

---

## Revenue Highlights

- **Sales tax** is up $300,000, driven largely by Gateway corridor development (OSF Healthcare, Tropical Smoothie, and other tenants moving in)
- **Hotel/motel tax** has ballooned from $65,000 a year to a projected $300,000 — a remarkable jump
- **State revenue (CPPRT)** is increasing $250,000 now that the state appears done clawing back prior overpayments
- **Income tax** is budgeted flat as a precaution, with rumblings in Springfield about freezing municipal allocations
- **Gaming tax** and **landfill revenue** each up $50,000, though staff warned that landfill revenue could eventually disappear if the Lee County landfill reaches capacity
- **Property tax levy** will show zero revenue in the general fund this year — the levy is being directed entirely to Social Security obligations and pension funds

---

## General Fund and Administration

The administration budget is down nearly 21%, but that's a reorganization, not actual cuts. The city's marketing coordinator position was shifted to a new PR/marketing budget line, and several items moved into a **new Human Resources department** within the budget. Staff emphasized the numbers are essentially flat once you account for the reshuffling.

Finance Director **Becky Leslie**, who joined the city in 2012 and has served as finance director for roughly eight years, is retiring in June. **Heather McCarter** is being groomed as her replacement. Leslie received a round of applause from those assembled — a well-earned send-off for someone staff described as instrumental to the city's fiscal management.

On the public works side, **Matt Heckman** is also retiring this summer after nearly 35 years. **Matt Hewitt** will become public works director, and **Cameron Magni** from the water department will step up as water manager.

## FOIAs: A Growing Problem

The city is getting hammered by Freedom of Information Act requests — many believed to be generated by bots. Police body camera footage requests are particularly labor-intensive, requiring staff to watch video and redact protected images. A **$15,000 placeholder** is in the budget to explore records management software that could automate much of this work. The alternative would be hiring another staff member, which the city would prefer to avoid.

---

## Economic Development

The economic development budget is flat. The city's contract with **Discovered Dixon** (currently $325,000) is up for review, with a presentation to council expected in March. **LCIDA** (Lee County Industrial Development Association) funding has been moved from the PR budget into economic development, where staff says it logically belongs.

Gateway corridor continues to be the star performer. Beyond the new tenants, staff noted the northern business district has stabilized with RP Lumber occupying the old ShopKo, investment on the County Market side, and continued industrial reinvestment from **Bonnell Industries** and **Sewer Equipment** — roughly $14 million in expansion from existing Dixon companies.

**Housing** remains a top priority. Washington Park (single-family homes on former school district land) is more than half filled. Developer Craig Wilson's team has added 24-32 new apartment addresses on Middle Road. Staff continues exploring workforce housing and 55-and-older housing options.

**Viaduct Point** — the area between the Peoria Avenue bridge and the new pedestrian bridge — is in the visioning phase, with development potentially beginning in FY 2028. The city may demolish the old Knack building and clear the former junkyard property this year to improve the area's appearance.

---

## Infrastructure

Over the past eight years, the city has resurfaced **40% of its streets** at a cost of $15.7 million. The ITEP pathway project added 2.2 miles (informally called the Riverwalk), and plans are in motion to extend the pathway from 7th Street to the Route 88 corridor through what's being called **Bloody Gulch Park** — funded in part by a **$2 million federal grant** from Congressman Eric Sorensen's office. The park will include retention ponds, fishing, and trails, with pond construction beginning this year.

**Project Rock** (the pedestrian bridge and path project through Page Park) is ahead of schedule and set to open in early summer, with a grand opening and 250th anniversary celebration planned for **July 4th**.

The city also wants to extend the pathway to **Sauk Valley Community College**, which would require collaboration with the Park District, SVCC, the school district, and Lee County.

---

## Fire Department

Chief Busco presented the fire department budget, funded primarily through the **Emergency Vehicle Fund** (ambulance fees), which projects $1.25 million in revenue.

Key capital items:
- **New ambulance**: $325,000 (ordered May 2024, delivery expected next fiscal year)
- **Joint training facility with Dixon Rural Fire**: Cost still being finalized, but the budget includes a placeholder for roughly half the total. Staff emphasized this is important because fewer actual fires mean firefighters need more live-fire training to stay sharp.
- **Starcom radio transition**: The fire department plans a gradual shift to Starcom radios (starting with officers), which offer better coverage and interoperability with other agencies. This will eventually eliminate the need for higher-powered mobile radios in apparatus.
- **Lighter-weight protective gear**: New gear for non-structural incidents (car accidents, brush fires) that should extend the life of more expensive structural turnout gear.

A **firefighter deployment** expected to begin in October will create staffing challenges; a placeholder for increased overtime is in the budget while staff works out the best approach.

---

## Police Department

New Chief Bivens presented his first budget, projecting an overall increase of **7.86%** ($361,000), with over $300,000 of that tied to contractual obligations (salary, overtime, insurance, and a $43,000 increase in the 911 dispatch contract).

Notable items:
- **Starcom radios**: Unlike fire's gradual approach, police are requesting a **complete switchover** at $410,000 — the single largest capital request. Dead zones in the current system are cited as an officer safety issue.
- **Investigative technology upgrades**: New software (Leads Online, Nighthawk) for investigators, plus increased costs for the Cellebrite forensic phone download program
- **Squad cell phones**: Each patrol car will get a cell phone so officers can remain mobile and use the cameras for evidence photography
- **Ballistic shields**: Every squad car will be equipped (some currently lack them)
- **Expired gas masks**: Being replaced — described as something that "slipped through the cracks"
- **Side-by-side utility vehicle**: For community events and hard-to-reach areas
- **Community app**: A $13,000 placeholder to explore launching a Dixon PD app for community engagement
- **Potential administrative assistant**: A placeholder exists to restore a position that previously existed, partly to help manage the FOIA workload
- **Community Service Officer**: The $18,000 budget line for the downtown CSO position (vacant 3-4 years since Mike Wilcox held it) remains, but the city manager asked council members to think about whether they want to continue or eliminate it.

---

## Streets and Properties

**Streets** budget up 5.24%, mostly personnel costs. Notable capital requests:
- **Downtown bollards and barriers**: $150,000 (includes $80,000 carryover) for enhanced event safety — still in the research phase
- **Street sweeper replacement**: $360,000 to replace a 2008 unit that's past its useful life
- **Dump truck**: $140,000 carryover, in production
- **LED street light conversion** continues ($25,000)
- **Kleen Avenue street lights**: $130,000 to complete the project (River Street to 3rd Street)

**Properties** budget is actually down 3.23%. Capital requests total $435,000, including:
- **City Hall north wall repair**: $140,000 — water infiltration is a problem because the wall was originally built against an adjacent building and wasn't designed for direct weather exposure
- **Chamber/Main Street building roof**: $100,000 for a complex, end-of-life roof
- **Riverfront fountain repairs**: $50,000 for underground plumbing leaks causing significant daily water loss
- **Christmas decorations**: $40,000 placeholder for the new pedestrian bridge and pathway areas

Council member Considine asked about the cost of repairing the Berlin Wall memorial, which was recently vandalized with graffiti. Staff said it's still being evaluated because the structure itself presents unique restoration challenges.

---

## Cemetery

The **Oakwood Cemetery** building project — largely completed with in-house labor — drew praise. The operating budget is up 3.25%.

Capital highlights:
- **Columbarium**: $50,000 for an above-ground cremation niche structure, reflecting the growing popularity of cremation. It would be placed in areas not suitable for traditional burials and is expected to generate revenue over time.
- **Mausoleum repairs**: $30,000 for engineering assessment this year, with an estimated $300,000 in actual repairs projected for FY 2028. Staff emphasized this needs professional engineering before any work begins.
- **Pickup truck replacement**: $65,000 (replacing a 2003 model with 106,000 miles)

---

## Water Department

Cameron Magni, the incoming water manager, presented the water budget — his first — showing an overall increase of just **1.12%**. The 2.5% rate increase built into the water ordinance is reflected in projected revenues, along with higher metered usage as the city's largest industrial user recovers from COVID-era declines.

Major capital item: **Water Tower #9 rehabilitation** at $550,000 for a full blast, repaint, and interior touch-ups, expected to provide 25 years of service life. The tower is located near Culver's.

Staff also flagged that **filter pipe failures** at the main plant and various wells will likely require ongoing replacement spending over the next several years. Two in-house water main projects (East 5th Street and the ongoing Factory/West 9th Street work) total $115,000.

---

## Wastewater

Wastewater rates have been frozen for four years and will see their first **2.5% increase** this fiscal year. The operating budget is up 5.85%, mostly personnel and utility costs. Credit card processing fees for utility billing drove a 16% increase in contractual services.

All capital items are **carryovers** — no new requests. The major wastewater treatment plant renovation ($25 million project) has begun construction but cold weather has limited progress. Completion is targeted for **December 2027**, though supply chain issues may push that out. When finished, the plant should be good for 25-30 years. The city is pursuing EPA loan forgiveness to offset costs.

A new **Morton building** (similar to the Oakwood Cemetery building) is in design and should go to bid within months.

---

## Airport

The airport budget is up 12.28%, but nearly all increases are **reimbursable** through federal and state funding. Capital projects include:
- **Terminal building modernization** (ADA compliance): ~$641,000, with only $20,000 from local funds
- **Runway 12/30 rehabilitation**: ~$980,000 total, carryover from last year
- **New AWOS weather system**: ~$650,000, mostly federal bipartisan infrastructure funds
- **Hangar repairs**: $40,000, local funds only

The standard airport funding formula is 90% federal, 5% state, 5% local — making these projects remarkably efficient uses of city dollars.

---

## The Capital Fund Question

City Manager Danny closed with a broader concern. The **general capital fund** (which pays for squad cars, dump trucks, and similar equipment) has no dedicated funding source. It relies on year-end "turn-ins" — surplus money from other funds. Those surpluses have been declining and are unlikely to return to the $3 million+ levels seen in some past years. Staff projects they may settle around $1.5 million or even lower.

The fund is healthy now, and the city is fine for the next five or six years. But staff is beginning to analyze whether longer-lived purchases (like a street sweeper with a 20-year lifespan) should be financed rather than paid in cash, spreading the cost across the years of use rather than burdening a single year's budget. No decisions have been made, but it's a conversation the council should expect to continue.

A **seawall project** estimated at $700,000 — described as essential if unglamorous — will be presented at Wednesday's session, with staff recommending it be funded from this year's turn-in allocation.

---

## Buying Local

Councilman Considine reminded everyone of his interest in purchasing vehicles locally. The city manager confirmed the city has a standing arrangement with **Ken Nelson** dealership, with council policy setting how much above state bid pricing the city will pay to keep purchases local.

---

## What's Next

The council will continue budget review at its next session on Wednesday, covering remaining departments including human resources details and the seawall project. The final FY 2027 budget is expected to be adopted within roughly six weeks.
