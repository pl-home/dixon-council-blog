# Dixon City Council Special Meeting Summary – February 23, 2025

## Budget Season Kicks Off

The Dixon City Council held a special work session to begin reviewing the proposed fiscal year 2027 budget (May 1, 2025 – April 30, 2026). City Manager Danny Langloss led the presentation, with department heads walking council members through their individual budgets. Here's what taxpayers need to know.

## The Big Picture

The city projects finishing roughly **$68,000 in the black** — a razor-thin margin that underscores a reality city leaders openly acknowledged: even with significant new revenue, rising costs are consuming nearly every dollar.

**Two major cost drivers** are squeezing the budget:
- **Health insurance:** A 20% increase is expected in January 2026. Langloss noted communities outside the city's insurance pool are facing increases as high as 45%.
- **Public safety pensions:** The combined annual pension payment for police and fire now exceeds **$3 million**, up $188,000 this year. The city issued pension bonds in 2023 and will be eligible to refinance them at the seven-year mark.

## New Revenue Keeping the City Afloat

The Gateway development along the Route 88 corridor is generating an estimated **$260,000 per year in new sales tax**. Hotel/motel tax revenue has jumped from $65,000 a year to a projected **$300,000** — a figure Finance Director Becky Leslie said she "never would have dreamed about" a few years ago. Together, that's roughly $560,000 in new money, but it's almost entirely consumed by rising expenses.

Other revenue changes:
- **CPPRT** (state-shared tax): Up $250,000 after the state finished clawing back prior overpayments.
- **Sales tax:** Budgeted up $300,000, driven by 88 corridor growth.
- **Income tax:** Up $100,000, though the state legislature may freeze municipal allocations. The city says its budget can absorb that if it happens.
- **Gaming tax:** Up $50,000.
- **Landfill revenue:** Up $50,000, though Leslie flagged this as a line that could eventually "become extinct" if the Lee County landfill reaches capacity.

Notably, the city will receive **zero dollars** from its real estate tax levy for the general fund this year. That money is being redirected to Social Security obligations and pension fund payments.

## Capital Fund: A Warning Light

The general capital fund — used to buy squad cars, dump trucks, and heavy equipment — has **no dedicated funding source**. It relies on year-end budget surpluses ("turn-ins"), and those surpluses are shrinking. The city started with $2.2 million in capital requests and trimmed them to $1.9 million. Staff recommended putting $1.5 million of this year's turn-ins into the fund, with $700,000 earmarked for a required seawall project.

Langloss was blunt: the days of $3 million surpluses aren't coming back. Pre-COVID turn-ins were sometimes as low as $800,000-$900,000. He said the fund is healthy for the next five to six years but the city may eventually need to finance longer-lasting equipment purchases rather than paying cash.

## Department-by-Department Highlights

### Administration & Organizational Changes
The admin budget dropped nearly 21%, but that's accounting, not austerity. The marketing coordinator position was shifted to a new PR/Marketing budget, and several line items moved into a **new Human Resources department** appearing in the budget for the first time.

### City Council
A **$15,000 placeholder** was added to investigate records management software for FOIA requests. The city says it's being "hammered" by freedom-of-information requests, many believed to come from automated bots. Processing police body camera footage for FOIA compliance is particularly time-consuming. The alternative would be hiring another staff member.

### Fire Department (Chief Busco)
- Ambulance revenue fund projects **$1.25 million** in fees for service.
- A **new ambulance** ordered in May 2024 ($325,000) should arrive during the fiscal year.
- The department is exploring a **joint training facility with Dixon Rural Fire**, with a placeholder of roughly half the total cost in the budget. Final numbers are still being developed.
- A **firefighter deployment** beginning potentially in October will require increased overtime spending — up 41% as a placeholder.
- The department is beginning a gradual transition to **Starcom radios**, starting with officers' portables, expected to take a couple of years.
- New lighter-weight protective gear will be purchased to extend the life of structural firefighting equipment.

### Police Department (Chief Bivens)
This was Chief Bivens' first budget presentation. He proposed an overall increase of **7.86% ($361,000)**, with over $300,000 of that tied to contractual obligations.

Key requests:
- **Starcom radio conversion:** A complete switchover at significant cost, driven by officer safety and interoperability with other agencies — something the department has pursued for 20 years.
- **Cell phones in every squad car** ($4,000): Officers can stay mobile for calls and use them as evidence cameras.
- **Ballistic shields for all squads** and replacement of expired gas masks.
- A **side-by-side utility vehicle** for community events and hard-to-reach areas.
- An **unmarked investigation vehicle** (buying used to save money).
- Investigation into a **department app** ($13,000 placeholder) to connect with the community.
- A **scheduling platform** ($2,000) replacing Google Calendar for training, court notices, and shift management.
- The dispatch contract alone increased by over $43,000.

A placeholder exists for an **additional administrative assistant** — restoring a position that previously existed — partly to handle the growing FOIA workload. The council was also asked to decide whether to continue funding the **community service officer** position (previously held downtown), which has been vacant for three to four years.

### Streets (Tyler, Public Works)
- Budget up 5.24%, mostly personnel costs.
- **$150,000 for downtown bollards and barriers** (includes $80,000 carryover) to enhance event safety — still under evaluation.
- **$360,000 for a street sweeper** to replace a 2008 model that's past its useful life.
- **$140,000 for a dump truck** (carryover, already in production).
- Continued **LED street light conversion** ($25,000) and completion of the **Clean Avenue street light project** ($130,000).
- **$20,000 added for salt shed repairs** due to corrosion damage.

### Properties
- Budget actually down 3.23% due to completion of one-time projects.
- **$140,000 for City Hall maintenance**, primarily to address water infiltration on the building's north wall — a problem stemming from the original construction, when an adjacent building provided weather protection that no longer exists.
- **$100,000 for the Chamber/Main Street building roof** (includes carryover).
- **$50,000 for riverfront fountain repairs** — underground plumbing leaks have been worsening for years.
- **$40,000 for Christmas decorations** along the new pedestrian bridge and pathway.
- **$65,000 for a pickup truck** to replace a 2005 model with 105,000 miles.

Council member Considine asked about the cost of repairing the Berlin Wall memorial that was recently vandalized with graffiti. Staff said estimates are still unknown due to the unique nature of the structure.

### Cemetery
- Operating budget up 3.25%.
- **$65,000 for a pickup** replacing a 2003 model.
- **$50,000 for a columbarium** — an above-ground structure for cremation remains, which would be revenue-generating over time.
- **$30,000 for mausoleum engineering assessment**, with an estimated $300,000 in repairs potentially coming in FY 2028. Staff emphasized this needs professional engineering given the structure's unique construction.

### Airport
- Operating costs up 12.28%, but nearly all increases are reimbursable through federal and state funding.
- **Terminal building modernization** is being engineered now, focused on ADA compliance. Funding: $450,000 federal, $151,000 in infrastructure bill money, $20,000 state, $20,000 local.
- **Runway 12/30 rehabilitation** has gone to bid and should begin this summer.
- A new **automated weather system (AWOS)** is also going to bid.
- **$40,000 in local funds** for hangar roof and fascia repairs on the revenue-generating rental hangars.

### Water Department
- Overall increase of just **1.12%** — notably lean for a first-time budget presentation by incoming Water Manager Cameron Magni.
- The 2.5% rate increase per ordinance continues.
- Major capital item: **Water Tower #9 rehabilitation for $550,000** (blast, repaint, interior work) near Culver's, expected to provide 25 years of service life.
- **$75,000 for continued Factory Street/West 9th Street water main work.**
- **$70,000 for deteriorating filter pipes** at the main plant, with staff warning this will be a multi-year issue across all wells.
- **$60,000 truck replacement** and **$40,000 tilt-back trailer** that will add hydro-excavation capability.

### Wastewater (Josh McNitt)
- Operating increase of **5.85%**, mostly personnel and rising electricity/natural gas costs.
- User fees will see their first increase in four years (2.5%), after being frozen while water rates went up.
- The **$25 million treatment plant overhaul** has begun construction, with a target completion of December 2027, though supply chain issues could push that out.
- A **new maintenance shed** is in design and should go to bid soon.
- The **Purity Mills lift station** project is also in design.
- Capital items are mostly carryovers from the current year.

## Personnel Notes

- **Becky Leslie**, finance director for approximately eight years, will retire in June. She received a standing ovation. **Heather McCarter** will succeed her.
- **Matt Heckman**, assistant city manager/public works director, will retire this summer after nearly 35 years. **Matt Hewitt** will become public works director.
- **Cameron Magni** will become water manager.
- Council was reminded that **elected officials' salaries are fixed** and any approved increases don't take effect until after the next election cycle.

## Other Items of Note

- The city has completed **40% of its streets** over the past eight years — $15.7 million in infrastructure investment.
- **Project Rock** (the riverfront/pathway project through Page Park) is ahead of schedule, with a grand opening and 250th celebration planned for **July 4th**.
- A **$2 million federal grant** was secured from Congressman LaHood for "Bloody Gulch Park," which will include retention ponds, fishing, and a pathway eventually connecting to the Route 88 corridor.
- **Viaduct Point** (between Peoria Avenue bridge and the pedestrian bridge) visioning continues, with development possibly beginning in FY 2027. The old Knack building and former junkyard property may be demolished this year.
- **Discovered Dixon** will present to council in March regarding its $325,000 contract, which may be extended to a three-year term.
- Councilman Considine raised the question of buying trucks locally. Langloss confirmed the city has a standing arrangement with Ken Nelson dealership, with council policy allowing a set premium above state bid pricing to keep purchases local.

## What's Next

The council will continue budget discussions Wednesday, covering the human resources department budget and the seawall project. The final FY 2027 budget is expected to be completed within roughly six weeks. Council members were encouraged to contact department heads with follow-up questions.
