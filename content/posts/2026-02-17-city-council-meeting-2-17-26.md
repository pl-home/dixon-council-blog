# Dixon City Council Meeting Summary — February 17, 2026

**Present:** Mayor Hughes, Councilmen Oros, Veneer, Bishop, and Considine

---

## Black History Month Recognition

The council devoted the first portion of the meeting to its ninth annual Black History Month celebration, featuring the Ike Mercer Certificate of Achievement Award and the Lifetime Achievement Award.

**Dantron Dodd** received this year's Ike Mercer Award for his community contributions, including co-owning T&D Barbecue and co-founding West Fest, a September community festival now heading into its third year. Previous award winner Diamond Robinson, currently serving in the U.S. military in Bahrain, joined by video to offer congratulations. Rashad Lane presented the award.

**George W. Reed** received the Lifetime Achievement Award posthumously (born 1919, Norfolk, Virginia). Reed was a World War II veteran who rode with the 9th and 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers, a prize fighter in New York City under the ring name "Kit Colby" (1935–42), a Golden Gloves trainer in Dixon for 10 years, and — along with Ted Truelock — brought the Girls Ponytail Softball League to Dixon in the 1970s, a league still active today. His son Terry accepted the award.

## IT and Cybersecurity Report

IT Director Phil Howard gave a presentation shifting the council's understanding of his department's role: the primary focus is now cybersecurity, not hardware repair.

Key points:
- **Mandatory cybersecurity training** has been in place for all city employees since 2023, as required by state law. Monthly phishing tests have been effective — employees now routinely flag suspicious emails rather than clicking bad links.
- **Cloud migration** is underway for the city's Laserfiche document management system and Caselle finance software. This should reduce hardware costs over time and improve system resilience during outages. Police department files will migrate this summer.
- **Weekly network vulnerability scanning** is conducted in-house, which Howard described as uncommon for governments and far cheaper than hiring third-party firms for one-time audits. The city has significantly reduced its exposure to known vulnerabilities.
- A **"Zero Trust" module** now prevents any unauthorized software from running on city computers, blocking malware that might be downloaded through phishing emails.
- The city's **email spam filter** will soon be replaced with a new product to address ongoing issues.

---

## Financial Items Approved

- **Total labor and outside claims:** $1,971,084.07 approved. Mayor Hughes noted that more than half of the outside claims amount was a $1 million CD reinvestment. Other notable expenditures included $193,582 for wastewater treatment plant improvements and $125,195 for public safety building second-floor improvements.
- **Year-to-date financials** through January 2026 were accepted without discussion.

---

## Motions Approved

**Minify Self Storage special use petition** — Referred to the Plan Commission for review. No details discussed.

**Emergency generator repair at Public Safety Building** — Council waived the formal bid process and approved a $36,649 emergency repair by Helm Electric. City Manager Shipman explained that the building's automatic transfer switch failed during a routine test, leaving the building without automatic backup power. Currently, switching must be done manually, and UPS battery backups provide only about 15–20 minutes. The IT infrastructure for both the public safety building and city hall is housed there, so a power failure effectively shuts down both buildings.

**Tactical communication headsets** — Approved purchase of 27 headsets from Atlantic Signal for $40,720.27 for the multi-agency Joint Operations Group (SWAT team comprising Dixon PD, Lee County Sheriff, Dixon Rural Fire, and Dixon City Fire). Over $17,000 was raised through fundraising and donations from local businesses. The remainder comes from the city's bequest fund and contributions from partner agencies. Deputy Chief emphasized that previous cheaper headsets had repeatedly failed and that reliable communication is as critical as body armor.

**2026 Chevrolet Tahoe police vehicle** — Approved from Carle Emergency Vehicles as a turnkey purchase (vehicle plus police equipment upfitting). No new money required. Council discussion touched on the ongoing tension between supporting local vendors and the practical reality that police vehicle upfitting is a specialty service with few local providers and long wait times. Councilman Bishop and the Deputy Chief indicated they've been meeting with the police chief to develop a longer-term vehicle procurement plan now that post-COVID supply chain issues have eased.

**Collateral assignment — Dixon Lodging/Sauk Valley Bank** — Approved. This allows Dixon Lodging LLC to use future TIF (Tax Increment Financing) funds as collateral with Sauk Valley Bank. The city confirmed this creates no financial obligation for Dixon — it simply acknowledges the TIF assignment.

## Ordinances and Resolutions

**Disposal of four police vehicles** — A 2009 Tahoe, 2011 F-150, 2011 Ford Edge, and 2013 Dodge Charger will be sold through online auction. The vehicles have exceeded their useful life for police work but still have resale value. One council member raised a question about the perception of unused police vehicles sitting in the public safety building parking lot.

**Three budget amendments** (all internal fund transfers, no new money):
- **Police DUI Fund:** Moved funds into the vehicle line item to pay for the new Tahoe.
- **Street Department:** Transferred $15,000 from salaries to maintenance/repairs to cover dump truck breakdowns during plowing season.
- **Water Department:** Transferred $15,000 from repairs to engineering to cover unplanned costs related to a grant application and new IEMA regulatory compliance.

**Closed session minutes review** — Approved per routine review process.

---

## Council Reports

- **Mayor Hughes** highlighted Dixon High School wrestling: five individual wrestlers heading to state, with two potential alternates.
- **Councilman Bishop** added that the wrestling team won regionals and sectionals and will compete as a team at state in Bloomington, with a legitimate shot at a trophy. He also recognized School Resource Officers Matt Coffey and Ryan McWethy during national SRO Week, praising their role not just in school safety but as mentors and trusted adults for students.
- **Councilman Considine** thanked Councilman Veneer for his work organizing the Black History Month recognition and paid tribute to Rev. Jesse Jackson, who died earlier that day.
- **Councilman Oros** echoed support for the SROs.
- **Councilman Veneer** kept it brief: "Dixon's just a great place to call home."

The mayor noted he recently toured the public safety building and praised its condition.

The meeting was adjourned with no additional business.

Will you pray with me?
Dear Lord, we come before you now giving you thanks for tonight.
Thank you for life, health, and strength.
Thank you for the work that takes place here in this room.
And we're grateful for this part, for part of the occasion, Lord God, in celebrating black history.
Black history is not just black history, but it is American history.
And we're grateful for the honor to be able to share with icons, Lord God, that have helped to shape this nation and this city.
Lord God, we also pray for the family of a great icon that passed today, Reverend Jesse Jackson.
Lord, we also ask you to bless this time and let us always remember that we're one together.
In Jesus' name, amen.
Amen.
Thank you, Pastor.
At this time, I'd like to turn the microphone over to Councilman Mike Veneer to handle the presentations.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here this evening.
Black History Month celebrates 100-year anniversary this year.
It actually began as Negro History Week in 1926, initiated by historian Carter G. Woodson to recognize African American history and achievements.
The celebration was set in February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln.
February 12th, and Frederick Douglass, February 14th.
In 1976, it expanded to a full month during the nation's bicentennial.
The celebration was expanded from a week to a full month.
Every U.S. president since Gerald Ford has officially proclaimed February as Black History Month,
with Congress codifying the designation into law.
In 1986.
Here in Dixon, we celebrate our ninth year of recognition with the Ike Mercer Certificate of Achievement Award.
As we all know, Mr. Mercer was a highly recognized member of our community in his broad community service and volunteer involvement.
The Certificate of Achievement, we started in 2008.
In 2018, and you'll see on the screen, all of the past recipients of the award.
And in 2024, we added the Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing our senior members and those who have gone before us.
At this time, I would like to introduce one of our previous award winners.
Ms. Diamond Robinson, who is joining us from Bahrain, as she still serves for her United States.
And she's going to say a few words to us.
Good evening, everybody. Good to see you, everybody.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Thank you, Council.
What I'd like to say...
I think it's grateful for the recognition that you guys have continuously done for us and continue to shine a light on the history, as Pensacola said, not just black history, but American history and the contributions that our own community members continue to make.
This year is special to me.
I want to go over to Dan, John, John.
Oh, man.
Just so happy for you and just very proud of everything that you've done and accomplished and all these years and the efforts and the hard work come to fruition.
It's just great to see.
The body's been so proud of the West Side.
It's been continuously bringing community and showing everybody what we're able to do with the West Fest and then you've grown up enjoying so much good food throughout the years.
And now the community gets to enjoy it too through your great, great, great business, T&D.
Shout-out to you.
If you haven't tried it, you're missing out.
Touch the Taste Buds.
And so happy to see the family that you've been surrounded by.
And it's great to see everybody so blessed to continue to honor Uncle Ike Mercer and watch him be a pillar in this community.
And the community wants to be a pillar in the community.
church and now we're able to add to that legacy as well so and your family too your wife and your
kids you're giving them something to look up to and continuously shine for and strive to achieve
for themselves one day so again very proud to give much love to you and can't wait to see how

you're so fortunate and giving glory to god to be able to travel safely
you
and who are go ahead go ahead give it up
so tell me about your your task force
you
logistics i'm used to just ordering everything and making sure that on a daily basis you have
everything from your uniforms to your pencils but this command being with the tensions were
over all the assets so a lot of the ships that you have come out here from the carriers to the
little small boys to even some coast guard ships we just make sure that they're logistically ready
and willing to get to the fighters we need to so again very different being this close to any type
of tension but still important nonetheless and still just giving my best with the
um
intelligence
that i've gotten and continuously again appreciating the support from everybody
so what
time is it over there
i'm two thirty seven
you can see what i'm turning it up just to sit at the table and enjoy it
after that
my
private
there's a seemed to be a couple of
patients there sat with me and the 된
for within the world
but in the same moment everything who was there wasany
and then if we weren't when Horsemans in the south at the bottom half of the
stand where we waited for a long timeacağ
did that you may say was too large in good taste right here for the first test at work
what else that you did that you did that degree with consequences um tell me about that thành
very often. We can celebrate them from the smallest victories to the greatest achievements.
So, again, thank you guys everybody. Shout out to you guys again. I'm proud of you guys.
Thank you, Diamond. Thank you so much for keeping up.
Stay with us. All right. At this time, I would like to introduce Rashad Lane. He's going
to give us a little intro here as well.
Thank you, Council, for having me tonight.
Thank you.
Good evening, everyone.
Council, wait a minute. Rashad here, you won't take a microphone, I think. Make sure
you're on and step back just a little bit.
All right. We should be good. It's truly an honor to present the Ike Mercer Award to someone
who represents the very spirit of community, connection, and service.
Dan Trondato,
of Dixon, Illinois. Alongside his wife, Courtney, Dan Trondato is a proud co-owner of T&D Barbecue,
but what he serves goes beyond great food. Through his love of cooking, he brings people
together, families, friends, neighbors, creating spaces where conversation happens, laughter
is shared, and community is strengthened. He's also the proud father of Prosper and
Chloe, and anyone who knows Dan Trondato knows that family is the center of everything that
he does. That same love, care, and commitment he pours into his children is reflected in
the way he serves.
This is a gift from the community, and the team at Silas, who is a wonderful family.
And what we have is that community shows up for this community. His impact doesn't stop
there. As a co-founder of West Fest, he has helped build a summer tradition that uplifts
our small business community while creating a welcoming, family-friendly space where all
are welcomed. West Fest is more than an event, it's a reflection of his commitment to unity,
opportunity, and hometown pride. Dan Trond embodies leadership through service, entrepreneurship
with heart, and community with purpose. For those reasons and so many more, we would love
anymore, it is my pleasure to present the Ike Mercer Award to Dantron Dodd. Congratulations.
Just give us a few words, Dantron.
All right. Well, I just want to say thank you to God first, and just give all praise
to him, because I know everything is possible through God, and I want to give thank you
to my family for always supporting me and always helping me, and telling me even when
I do serve something, if it's good and even if it's bad. So I want to thank them for being
my greatest critics, and I want to just give thank you to all my supporters, everybody
that showed up for T&D Barbecue.
And that's been able to try it and that spread the word, or just liked the video, and I just
want to thank everybody. And I want to give a shout out to Brandon Hill, the owner of
B's Lemonade, and him and his wife, you know, they helped me do West Fest. We came up with
it together, and he's definitely a big part of it, and he's doing big things out here,
so I just want to acknowledge him, since I'm getting acknowledged today. And yeah, I just
want to say thank you. It's amazing. I would say thank you for everything that my Uncle
Ike has done for the community, and everybody.
He's an amazing person.
Thank you.
He's been inspired and motivated, and I just hope that I can do the same. So thank you.
Thank you to everybody that came tonight.
And, of course, thank you to D-Rob for staying up and doing that for me, because I definitely
appreciate you. And West Fest every year is going to be in September. This will be our
third year, and we plan on making it bigger and bigger every year, so come out, show up,
and we'll see you there.
We're going to show y'all a good time.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Good job, brother.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All right, well done. Thank you so much, everyone. In 2024, we added the Lifetime Achievement
Award. As you can see, Mrs. Ashford, Mr. Dishman, who served here on this council, and this year's
recipient.
Mr. George W. Reed. And I know we all are familiar with George. Just a little bit about
him. He was born November 7th, 1919, in Norfolk, Virginia. He married Rose Collins on November
18th, 1946, here in Dixon, Illinois. Together, they had one son, Terry, who resides here
in Dixon, and one grandson, James, who resides in Phoenix, Arizona. George served in the
World War II, where he rode with the 9th and 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers. George also coached
ladies baseball throughout the area, and he took his team up against the Rockford Peaches
in Rockford, Illinois. In the 1970s, George and Ted Truelock brought to Dixon the Girls Ponytail
Softball League, which is still a thriving youth sports league in our community today. George was
also a prize fighter from 1935 to 1942 in New York City. And I just got an information, what was
his, Kit Colby was his ring name, and he was a prize fighter from 35 to 42, and then he became
a Golden Gloves trainer in Dixon right here for 10 years, and he trained the likes of Grady Daniels.
And Grady Daniels went to the World Boxing Championship, where he fought Jerry Cooney,
and he won the Golden Gloves. So, George also was a lifetime member of the Second Baptist Church
here in Dixon, and we're honored to have George as this year's Lifetime Achievement Award. And I want
to thank his stepson, Stuart Cox, for the additional information that he added to tonight's
event. So, on behalf of the city of Dixon and Black History Month, we award this to George Reed
and his son, Terry.
I just want to thank everybody for coming out. Between Mr. Mercer and my father, well, you know,
we're part of the community, the old guys, you know. So, I just want to thank everybody.
Anything else?
On behalf of Mr. Reed?
Well done, Terry.
On that, we will close Celebration of Black History Month. We thank you all again. We look forward to
more recipients next year. God bless you all.
We'll pause for a moment.
Thanks, guys.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah, have a great night. Thank you.
Thank you.
See you, guys.
See you, guys.
Oh, those peanuts.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
Thank you.
I didn't know we were still doing this.
I don't know.
I was going to ask you.
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't know.

Okay.

moving on to department reports you will find in the packet and will be placed online the
permit summary for the month um additionally i believe we have an in-person presentation by our
i.t director mr phil howard yes would you like to inform us sure so good evening um yeah so first
thing i kind of wanted to talk about is the department is information technology which is
accurate to a point really the department used to be just that and that would be repairing the
computers taking care of hardware and physical items and things like that and that is actually
a very small portion of what is done in the information technology department these days
the bigger portion by far is now cyber security the computers pretty much run themselves they
stay running as long as we keep them up to date and we do that through automatic tools make sure
one the viruses malware don't get in it but two just that they're they're safe and secure for our
users to use and the information technology department is responsible for our computers
internally for our employees not for outside vendors we don't really we don't run a city-wide
internet we don't run public-facing utilities i mean we have the water and wastewater but as
far as information technology utilities we don't offer you know tools like that so the department
information technology is really to keep our internal systems running
and secure so i just kind of wanted to bring that to your attention cyber security is really the
primary thing for every business these days you have to protect against theft and other items that
can get into your system obviously we don't want that not with police and fire we need to keep
those systems running 24 7 365 and we've done very well on that back in 2023 the state mandated that
all government employees basically in the state have to have cyber security training
and beginning that year we started doing a mandatory training for all of our users as well
which included doing a video training and then also email testing where you get a test email each
month and it kind of you know gives you an option to to click on it and say yeah this recognizes this
is spam or it's a phishing attempt and it has been very effective when we started out people would
click on those links and they'd get a screen and pop up say oops you goofed you know that kind of
thing most of the time now people will call me or send me a separate email say hey is this a
legitimate email that's great but it's not a legitimate email that's a different email that's
great that means they're paying attention they're looking they're seeing what they're doing so
this training is very effective and i'm very excited about that
so for the past three years we've had that for all of our employees we've had a couple
miss it here and there and we try to get them to fill in but by far and large we've gotten
everybody through it each year and it works really well a couple other things i wanted to kind of
highlight that we've done here recently some of our software products are kind of moving to the
cloud which has been kind of the general term over the last 15 years really systems are starting to
move to the cloud and what that means is rather than running them on a computer here in our
office it's running on the company's servers somewhere in the cloud and we log into it kind
of like a website usually and there are some benefits to doing that in some cases in some
cases it is more expensive so we try not to do it just because it's there we're going to do it if
it's more effective and either cost effective or provides better service for our employees
and most recently we've done our laserfish system which is really just a file management system
the hr department the city clerk uses it pretty profoundly the pd uses it as well although theirs
did not migrate yet just because of some items that the laser fist has to finish before we can
do that and that'll happen this summer the benefit for us in doing that is it's a little bit more
resilient so if we were to have an outage here we could have a different internet and get to it
easily also it will over time lower our cost because we have less hardware that we need to
store all those images on and we have less software on site
that goes along with this that we have to use and that kind of ties into our finance software
as well that's going to be moving to the cloud here very shortly and again very similar these
two kind of tie together laserfish and caselle and that's why we wanted them both trying to go
simultaneously so we won't see an immediate reduction in cost but over time
we will see some items go off the list it won't won't be in our system anymore so the cloud is
benefiting us um slowly but surely our stuff is moving that way and it will be a benefit long term
a couple other things that we have going on and this has been going on for a long time is network
testing basically we have a software product that goes in and it essentially tries to hack our own
network is what it does it's looking for all those holes that are known to all the software vendors
to see if we have those in there and it's very important because of all the systems and hardware
that we have that we test for those things because there's no way that you can keep up on top of every
single one of those every single day so this scan runs weekly and it checks to see if there's
anything new they they're all running on top of it and that's where the software is going to be
Their software is tremendous.
We've found several things that have popped up.
So we've been able to fix them right away when they come up.
And this is something that is highly recommended
that all businesses and governments do,
and most of them don't.
Partly because some of them just don't know
how to go about getting started with it,
and some, they get a third-party vendor to do it,
and it can be really expensive,
and you only get a one-time report.
This system we have is excellent
because it gives us a weekly report.
It's run every week.
We get current data, it's not outdated,
so we know what's going on.
And we've reduced our exposure, is what they call it,
greatly by fixing all those things.
So if somebody were to get in our network,
it's gonna be a lot more difficult for them
to get around and actually try to take anything from us.
And that's the importance there.
And then to kind of go along with that
is a module we call Zero Trust.
This is kind of a little bit newer module for us,
but what it does is, like on your computer,
you would run a program,
and you could do whatever you want on your home computer.
It's yours.
Here, we only allow very specific programs.
If somebody, one of our users,
tries to download Firefox, for example,
I'll just throw that out there,
it's not gonna let it run on the computer
because it's not on our safe list
unless we actually add it to that list.
So no programs can run unless we say so.
The advantage of that is, for those emails,
when you click on a bad link
and it tries to download the malware,
and that's where most of the bad guys get in
is getting malware like that.
So this module is tremendous.
It's helping us keep those things out.
It's a great benefit for us.
And lastly, I just wanted to mention,
I know people just love email.
We love all the spam that comes in.
We are gonna change our filter a little bit.
We've had some issues with it.
I hope the new one will be a little bit better,
but it is something you'll see very soon.
It's just a, it'll be very similar,
just a different brand name on there.
But overall, I think our filtering has been quite effective.
We've gotten a lot of junk out,
and I think most of our users are at least happy
that they're not seeing as much junk,
which is a good thing.
So I don't know if you have any questions for me,
either on these or other things that we've been doing,
but yeah, just cybersecurity is really key, so.
Thank you, Ellen.
Thank you.
Great report.
And thanks for the PowerPoint work tonight, too,
for the Black History Month recognition.
That was well done.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
Anybody else want to jump up to the mic?
No, okay.
City manager's report.
No report this evening.
Thank you, Mayor.
Okay.
And I'll move on to council reports.
I really don't have much.
A lot was said already about Black History Month,
so I will just quickly pass that.
And wanted to mention that Dixon High School now has,
this year has five wrestlers going to state.
That's a pretty significant number
of wrestlers going to state.
I believe two of those are first place,
and then some seconds and thirds.
We also, in addition to those five
that are definitely going to state,
we have the potential
for two alternates as well, so, based on their finishes.
So, right now, also hoping the girls continue on their trend,
but we got to wait and see how they go through regionals,
and that's yet to be done.
But I really wanted to mention our wrestlers, so.
Councilman Bishop.
I'm going to add one more thing to the wrestlers.
They won regionals.
They won against Morrison for the sectionals,
so they're actually going to be in state, too.
Not this weekend, which will be individual.
The weekend after that, they'll be down in Bloomington.
So, they got a chance to win a trophy,
a really good chance.
For the whole team.
Yeah.
And so.
That's awesome.
That's awesome.
It's going to be some exciting news, I think,
in the next couple of weeks for us, so it's great.
My only thing for today is it's SRO week,
so our school resource officers,
both Matt Coffey and Ryan McWethy,
we just want to throw shout outs to those guys.
Really appreciate what they do inside the schools.
They kind of, I won't say they live in two worlds,
but that's probably accurate,
whether they're on the road at certain times
or in those schools.
But I know, obviously, we know everything at Dixon High School
and the past where we had the shooting
and things fell the right way for us.
Invaluable as far as having that resource officer there.
But they do a lot more than that.
They're interacting with those kids every day.
And they're really becoming more than just a law enforcement
resource.
They're somebody.
That they can go to, have conversations with,
talk about things in life that maybe aren't the easiest
sometimes.
And they're active with those kids in those schools.
So really appreciate the resource officers.
And that's coming from me as a teacher, parent,
person in the community that sits up on this board.
They're important.
So thank you.
Appreciate.
So that's all I have, Mayor.
Thank you.
Councilman Considine.
Thank you.
I want to thank Councilman.
I've been here for his hard work and effort
that he puts into black history a month and week for us
at the city here.
It's a lot of commitment.
And to Alan for his support.
And then I also want to put a shout out
to the famous, wonderful Mr. Jesse Jackson that passed.
I know Reverend Cole paid respect to it.
But he was a vital part to our culture and our society.
And I feel bad because now another voice has
been silenced.
And it frightens me as an old man of who's
going to pick up those torches for the rest of us
and keep going.
But we have to have faith.
But I hope that you can remember him in your prayers.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Councilman Oros.
I echo all the sentiments that we had tonight.
I was going to highlight, as Councilman Bishop did,
our SO officers.
And I'm going to go ahead and say a few things.
Thank you.
And just appreciate the commitment
that they make within our schools that
goes far and beyond the call of duty that they have.
So I just wanted to acknowledge that.
Thank you.
Councilman Vanier.
No real report.
Dixon's just a great place to call home.
Thank you.
I think we can all echo that.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
All right.
Moving on to motions.
The first item you have is the refer petition
for special use from Minify Self Storage Genoa, LLC.
This is purely a referral, nothing for us
to address at this time.
Thank you, Pastor.
Other than whether or not we're comfortable referring it
on to the plan commission.
Do I have a motion?
Motion.
I move to refer the petition for a special use from Minify Self
Storage Genoa, LLC to the plan commission.
Motion, Vanier.
Do I have a second?
Second.
Second, Bishop.
Are there any other comments?
Hearing none, roll call.
Councilman Oros.
Aye.
Councilman Vanier.
Yes.
Councilman Bishop.
Aye.
Councilman Considine.
Aye.
Mayor Hughes.
Aye.
Then, motions 13B, discussion of possible approval to waive formal bid process.
Do I have a motion on that?
I move to waive the formal bid process for emergency repair to the electrical system
of the public safety building.
Second.
Second, Vanier.
Mr. Shipman.
Thank you, Mayor.
As I've been able to fill most of you in on, we recently were having some issues with our
generator system at the public safety building.
Most recently, about a week ago, I got a call that we didn't have a power outage, but they
were out of power at the public safety building.
It went through its test and transferred, and it failed to transfer.
So I got a company down.
They could look at it.
It's kind of a specialty item, and the transfer switch gear has failed in it, so it needs
to be replaced.
So currently, we don't have any, well, we do have emergency power, but we have to manually
do all the switching.
So I'm asking and requesting that we waive the bid, the formal bidding, so that we can
get this repaired quickly.
Rush Power and Helm Electric, who does a lot of our electric work, they're able to have
a transfer switch for us.
We don't have to order it.
And we can get that back up and running soon.
Knock on wood, we don't have a lot of power outages, but when we do at that building especially,
because as Alan was talking about, a lot of the IT equipment, even for this building or
in that building, so when we lose power, we pretty much lose everything over here as well.
So just requesting to waive that bidding.
Do we have a figure of what this possibly might cost?
Yes.
The next item, Councilman, is then to approve it.
So they've given us a...
Oh, okay.
Yep.
That's kind of a worse because they've factored in two days of work to do this change out,
but it's $36,649.
Thank you.
Not cheap.
Okay.
So at this time, we're going to address the waiver of the...
Right.
...of the...
Okay.
...bid process.
Is there any other questions?
When power goes out, how long will the system keep us going?
So, well, there's UPSs on the computers and stuff over there now, and we can get about
15, 20 minutes, roughly, on the UPSs.
But when the generator transfers, if it's operating correctly, it's up and running within
60 seconds.
So if we have a power outage, it's 60 seconds.
If we have a power outage, it's back up.
And then the UPSs aren't needed.
But we do have those.
So yeah, if we were having an outage, like now, we'd have to go over and there's a series
of things I have to do that we can get it manually started.
But yeah, it'd keep things going for about 15 minutes.
15 minutes?
With the UPSs that we have, yes.
Right.
And then once the generator's up and running, we can run.
It runs the whole entire building except the condensing units for the air conditioning.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Roll call.

Councilman Veneer?
Yes.
Councilman Bishop?
Aye.
Councilman Considine?

Mayor Hughes?

13C, discussion on possible approval of emergency repair to the electrical and generator.
Do I have a motion?
So moved.
I move to authorize the emergency repair to the electrical and generator system at the public safety building to be done by Helm Electric.
Second.
Motion to borrow.
Second.
Considine.
I think, was there anything else you wanted to address on that?
We've already brought up, but that's $36,649.
Any other questions about the actual work itself?
Hearing none.
Roll call.
Councilman Orris.
Aye.
Councilman Veneer.
Yes.
Councilman Bishop.
Aye.
Councilman Considine.
Aye.
Mayor Hughes.
Aye.
13D, discussion of possible approval to purchase tactical communication headsets.
Do I have a motion?
I move to approve the purchase of tactical communication headsets for the joint operations group from Atlantic Signal for $40,720.
$26.74.
Second.
Motion.
Considine.
Second.
Veneer.
Deputy Chief.
Hi, Mayor and Council.
How's everybody doing?
Fantastic.
Thank you.
So in reference to this request, first of all, this doesn't require any new funds.
This is actually because of the makeup of our joint operations group, which is a multi-agency SWAT team,
which consists of Dixon Police Department, Lee County Sheriff's Office, Dixon Rural Fire Department,
and Dixon City Fire Department.
Dixon City Fire Department.
Dixon City Fire Department.
Dixon City Fire Department.
Dixon City Fire Department.
Dixon City Fire Department.
Dixon City Fire Department.
So what we're able to do, first of all, we were able to raise over $17,000 in fundraising for this specific project
because the communication headsets, which will be rail-mounted on our ballistic helmets,
have been the Achilles heel of this team for a really long time.
Personally speaking, I was on the team for quite a while, and you do get what you pay for.
So when we were going to some other alternative means of communication, they were failing.
They were failing.
They were failing.
And what I will tell you is communication is just as important as the bulletproof vests that we wear.
Communication goes, bad things happen.
So aside from us doing the fundraising efforts, the money would come out of the Dixon City Bequest Fund,
the small tools, and then in conjunction with funds from the Dixon City Fire Department,
Dixon Rural Fire, and the Lee County Sheriff's Office.
And so we're technically the vendor name or the customer name on the account.
Through the supplier, and then we'll push everything to them to complete that purchase.
How many units does this get us?
We'd be looking at 27 headsets.
Any other questions?
Thank you for the fundraising efforts as well.
You're welcome.
Well done.
Definitely had a lot of generous donors and businesses around town, so that was huge.
How did these play into it?
I know we're talking maybe later on getting some new radios overall.
The thought, would these play into those as well?
They'll be compatible.
They'll have hookups that are compatible to our portable radios,
which would be, they're pretty similar to what the county already has.
And they have single push-to-talk features and different things that, safety features on them.
And obviously properties that if there's a shooting or anything of that nature,
it's able to protect our hearing.
So we're looking forward to not only being able to talk one-to-one or with the rest of the team,
but also protect our hearing.
Thank you.
Anything else?
Hearing none, roll call, please.
Councilman Oros?
Aye.
Councilman Veneer?
Yes.
Councilman Bishop?
Aye.
Councilman Considine?
Aye.
Mayor Hughes?
Aye.
13E, discussion and possible approval to purchase 2026.
Chevrolet Tahoe, do I have a motion?
I move to approve the purchase of a 2026 Chevrolet Tahoe with police package equipment,
installation from Carle Emergency Vehicles.
Motion Veneer, do I have a second?
Second.
Second, Bishop.
Okay.
You're still at it, Deputy Chief.
I'm still at it, yep.
Got a couple more tonight, it looks like.
So with this vehicle, this was, this Tahoe was actually set aside,
it looks like, and they just kind of had it set aside in December,
because considering us maybe a return customer,
so they had reached out to us and said they had one available.
And so I know Chief Bibbins had some discussions about this.
And with where we're going, they can upfit the vehicle as well.
So kind of a one-stop shop.
And so you can see the different totals there for the vehicle itself,
and then additionally for the equipment on top of that.
And I'll get into it later, I guess, where the money will be coming from.
Again, this will be purchased with no new money.
We'll be having another action form here in a little bit as far as where that will be coming from.
But it will just be for one squad car.
Any questions?
All right.
Just for the record, I know we had purchases with local vendors
and looked at the total package, not only.
The purchase of the vehicle, but also the installation of the equipment.
Correct.
Anything else?
So, and I know the chief's not here, so I'm not going to go too far on this.
But as we move forward, obviously, between COVID and how to do the catch-up
and things like that, and we're getting back into,
obviously we have new people there at the PD.
But I think we just go back and look at what our options are.
I mean, I talked to chief about it and where we get things
and make sure things go smoothly.
I know that the council has mentioned locals, where we want to be.
I think we're going to stand back on ground of let's take a look at the full picture
now that the world seems to be a little bit back to where it was, hopefully,
and kind of look at all things that go into it.
I can add to that that we have had some recent discussions as well.
Some pretty, we've had some,
just kind of trying to learn the process, I guess,
and where we're coming from,
and then what is the capability of our local resources as well.
So I think it was a step in the right direction.
Excellent. Thank you.
But see, I'm a big proponent of our local.
But in this situation with these vehicles and then the package that goes with them,
it's like a turnkey.
I don't mean to be talking out of both sides of my mouth.
Correct.
But I think it makes much more sense
Correct.
to immediately have the vehicle and then the package put right in where it is,
and we're not taking the vehicle somewhere else and waiting six months.
That slows the whole process and the purpose of getting a new vehicle.
So I'm 110% for the local thing.
But I think it's to your point, sir, and to yours, Mr. Bishop,
that we look at the situation.
But after having the meeting with the chief,
he didn't do a snow job on me,
but I pretty much picked up the answer.
Yeah.
And there's a lot that goes into it,
not only just purchasing the vehicle,
but having that upfitting because there are not a lot of vendors around here that can do that.
And I know the gentleman that would be considered local, he's inundated.
I mean, he's good at what he does, but the turnaround, he's only got a couple of people.
And when we need these vehicles, these are our offices too, right?
And we don't want to be running them to the ground.
And then,
having to wait too much longer and then we're paying a lot in maintenance too.
So it kind of, that kind of snowballs.
It's, yeah, it's tough sometimes.
So we just, knowing that this one was there and available and they can do everything in a very, very quick turnaround.
That's why we're moving on this one while we can.
But to Councilman Bishop's point, we are looking at the big picture.
And you said you had those meetings so we can be far enough out that we won't be under the gun of a smaller,
place putting in the package that we don't have to wait as long.
Correct.
The wait is long, but it won't be as imperative that we get it yesterday when they can have it in a month.
Right.
Correct.
That's where I am.
Yep.
Thank you.
Mm-hm.
Anything else?
All right, hearing none, roll call please.
Councilman Oros?
Aye.
Councilman Venier?
Yes.
Councilman Bishop?
Aye.
Councilman Considine?
Aye.
Mayor Hughes?
Aye.
Aye.
And then 13F, discussion of possible approval of collateral assignment between Dixon Lodging and Sauk Valley Bank.
Do I have a motion?
No, go ahead.
Okay.
Sorry.
I move to approve the collateral assignment of payments between Dixon Lodging LLC and Sauk Valley Bank and TrustCo.
Second.
Motion.
Bishop, second.
Venier?
This.
We have done one of these before, as a matter of fact, a year ago, January, I believe.
This is what the Dixon Lodging is looking at doing is utilizing their TIF funds and collateralizing those to the bank for possible payment or collateralization.
This is just, it does not put any commitment on our part.
We are merely acknowledging that those TIF funds are under assignment to the bank.
So we have no, nothing to be indemnified or anything.
Have we generated enough TIF funds to do that?
At this point, this is just for them, the bank itself, to take a collateral assignment.
Okay.
Whether the funds are available next year or five years.
Okay.
It's a matter of time.
It's a matter of time.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Five years from now is, at this point, irrelevant.
But they have a collateral, they would have a collateral assignment.
Anything else?
Very done.
Roll call, please.
Councilman Oros.
Aye.
Councilman Veneer.
Yes.
Councilman Bishop.
Aye.
Councilman Konstantin.
Aye.
Mayor Hughes.
Aye.
On to Ordinances 14A.
Okay.
Ordinance authorizing the disposal of certain personals.
property. Do I have a motion? I move to approve the ordinance authorizing the
disposal of certain personal property owned by the City of Dixon slash Dixon
Police Department vehicles. Motion. Oro Sec. Considine. And again, Deputy Chief.
All right. So our four vehicles that we have are, the one is a 2009 Chevy Tahoe.
Another one is a 2011 Ford F-150, a Ford Edge, 2011 Ford Edge, and a 2013 Dodge
Charger, which is currently being utilized as an SRO vehicle. These vehicles have
kind of gone past their usefulness for us, but they're still at a point where we
can sell them and we haven't run them to the ground. So we feel like where they're
at right now, they could be a good use to somebody else on a private
party, but no longer because of the mileage and everything would be useful
for us. We utilize an online auction service that I would be putting online
after taking some pictures and getting gathering all the information, and
that's where we go from there whenever we sell that kind of property. So that's
our hopes that we can get those sold online and go from there. Any questions? So, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.
So are these four, so these have been in use up to recent. Are any of these vehicles
parked, permanently parked in the parking lot by the Public Safety Building?
Probably, I think it's just the marked Dodge Charger, the black and white that's
out there, that would be used by Officer Coffee. And then the other ones are in
another location outside of town. Okay, so this will help at least take one
vehicle out of that parking lot? Yes.
Thank you. Are you concerned with the perception that we have so many vehicles that are sitting up there? No, there was an event at the
post house the other night, and they just asked why we have so many vehicles sitting up there. Protect their happy butts.
That don't move. I think we'll move on to roll call.
I think we'll move on to roll call.
That was the concern.
Okay, fair enough.
Councilman Orrus?
Aye.
Councilman Venier?
